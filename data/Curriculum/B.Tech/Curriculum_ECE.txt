Communication:  
Because communication is so  important in business, businesses want and need people 
with good communication skills. Business communication is a blend of skills like writing 
and speaking well, displaying proper etiquettes and listening attentively.  
Communications through technology gr eatly enhances one’s ability to communicate 
effectively and articulately. For example, E -mails often result in a sender’s language 
skills being placed in front of different people simultaneously; while audio and video will 
reveal the calibre of one’s verba l and diplomatic strengths. The communication aspect 
of the English for Communication Course includes:   
 
1. The Basics of Business Communication  
2. Importance of Listening  
3. Barriers in the Communication Process  
4. Business Letters (Letter of Inquiry, Com plaint, Cover Letter)  
5. Resume Writing  
6. Memo and Memo Reports  
7. Report Writing  
8. Fax and E Mail  
 
English Laboratory:  
Objective: The laboratory component included in the course provides an ideal platform 
for students to prepare themselves into confident and self -assured individuals. The Lab 
course is designed to inculcate confidence and clarity in presentation and expression of 
thought, views and ideas through practice and exercises. It constitutes six basic 
components to improve listening, read ing and writing skill of the students.   
Lessons:  
1. Pronunciation (Basic sounds of English like   Long/Short Vowels; All consonants)  
2. Stress Intonation (Rising and Falling)  
3. Speaking - Oral Presentations, Group Discussions, Story Telling, Role Plays  
4. Listening – Importance and Practice  
5. Reading - Practice  
6. Writing (Paragraph writing, good writing and bad writing with samples, Indianism),  
Grammar (Basic - Articles, Prepositions, Verbs, Common Errors , etc)
