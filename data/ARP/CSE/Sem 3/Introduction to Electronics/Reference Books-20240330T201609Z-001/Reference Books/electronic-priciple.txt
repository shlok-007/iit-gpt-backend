Learning Features
Many learning features have been incorporated into the eighth edition of 
Electronic Principles.  These learning features, found throughout the chapters, 
 include:
CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
Each chapter begins with a brief introduction setting 
the stage for what the student is about to learn.
chapter           5
Rectiﬁ  er diodes are the most common type of diode. They are 
used in power supplies to convert ac voltage to dc voltage. But 
rectiﬁ  cation is not all that a diode can do. Now we will discuss 
diodes used in other applications. The chapter begins with the 
zener diode, which is optimized for its breakdown properties. 
Zener diodes are very important because they are the key to 
voltage regulation. The chapter also covers optoelectronic 
diodes, including light-emitting diodes (LEDs), Schottky diodes, 
varactors, and other diodes.

the students to key words found in the chapter. Within 
the chapter, these key words are highlighted in bold 
print the fi  rst time used.CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
Chapter Objectives provide a concise statement of 
 expected learning outcomes.xii Guided Tour(a)Figure 3-15  Data sheet for 1N4001–1N4007 diodes. (Copyright Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation. Used by permission.)
EXAMPLES
Each chapter contains worked-out circuit Examples 
and Application Examples that demonstrate important 
concepts or circuit operation, including circuit analysis, 
applications, troubleshooting, and basic design.
Application Example 5-12
Figure 5-22 a shows a voltage-polarity tester. It can be used to test a dc voltage of 
unknown polarity. When the dc voltage is positive, the green LED lights up. When 
the dc voltage is negative, the red LED lights up. What is the approximate LED 
current if the dc input voltage is 50 V and the series resistance is 2.2 k V?

and switches.  How  much  LED  current  is there  if the series  resistance  is 470 V?
SOLUTION   When the input terminals are shorted (continuity), the internal 
9-V battery produces an LED current of:
IS 5   9 V 2 2 V _________  470 V   5 14.9 mA
PRACTICE PROBLEM 5-13   Using Fig. 5-22 b, what value series resistor 
should be used to produce 21 mA of LED current?
Application Example 4-1
Figure 4-3 shows a half-wave rectifi  er that you can build on the lab bench or on a computer screen with Multisim. An 
 oscilloscope is across the 1 k V. Set the oscilloscope’s vertical input coupling switch or setting to dc. This will show us 
the half-wave load voltage. Also, a multimeter is across the 1 k V to read the dc load voltage. Calculate the theoretical 
values of peak load voltage and the dc load voltage. Then, compare these values to the readings on the  oscilloscope and 
the multimeter.
SOLUTION Figure 4-3 shows an ac source of 10 V and 60 Hz. Schematic  diagrams usually show ac source voltages 
as effective or rms values. Recall that the effective value  is the value of a dc voltage that produces the same heating  effect 
as the ac voltage.
Figure 4-3  Lab example of half-wave rectiﬁ  er.
GOOD TO KNOW
Good To Know statements, found in 
the margins, provide interesting added 
insights to topics being presented.p
Figure 5-1 a shows the schematic symbol of a zener diode; Fig. 5-1 b is an alterna-
tive symbol. In either symbol, the lines resemble a z, which stands for “zener.” 
By varying the doping level of silicon diodes, a manufacturer can produce zener 
diodes with breakdown voltages from about 2 to over 1000 V . These diodes can 
operate in any of three regions: forward, leakage, and breakdown.
Figure 5-1 c shows the I-V graph of a zener diode. In the forward region, 
it starts conducting around 0.7 V , just like an ordinary silicon diode. In the leak-
age region  (between zero and breakdown), it has only a small reverse current. In a 
zener diode, the breakdown has a very sharp knee, followed by an almost vertical 
increase in current. Note that the voltage is almost constant, approximately equal 
to VZ over most of the breakdown region. Data sheets usually specify the value of 
VZ at a particular test current IZT.
Figure 5-1 c also shows the maximum reverse current IZM. As long as 
the reverse current is less than IZM, the diode is operating within its safe range. If 
the current is greater than IZM, the diode will be destroyed. To prevent excessive 
 reverse current, a current-limiting resistor  must be used (discussed later).
Zener Resistance
In the third approximation of a silicon diode, the forward voltage across a diode 
equals the knee voltage plus the additional voltage across the bulk resistance.GOOD TO KNOW
As with conventional diodes, the 
manufacturer places a band on 
the cathode end of the zener 
diode for terminal identification.PRACTICE PROBLEMS
Students can obtain critical feedback by perform-
ing the Practice Problems that immediately follow 
most Application Examples. Answers to these 
problems are found at the end of each chapter.
MULTISIM
Students can “bring to life” many of the circuits 
found in each chapter. The Instructor Resources 
section on Connect for Electronic Principles con-
tains Multisim fi  les for use with this textbook. Over 
350 new or updated Multisim fi  les and images have 
been created for this edition; with these fi  les, stu-
dents can change the value of circuit  components 
and instantly see the effects, using  realistic Tektro-
nix and Agilent simulation  instruments. Trouble-
shooting skills can be  developed by inserting circuit 
faults and making circuit measurements. Students 
new to computer simulation software will fi  nd a 
Multisim Primer in the appendix.DATA SHEETS
Full and partial component data sheets are  provided 
for many semiconductor devices; key specifi  cations 
are examined and explained. Complete data sheets 
of these devices can be found on the Instructor 
Resources section of Connect.Guided Tour xiiiCOMPONENT PHOTOS
Photos of actual electronic devices bring students 
closer to the device being studied.
SUMMARY TABLES
Summary Tables have been included at important 
points within many chapters. Students use these 
 tables as an  excellent review of important topics 
and as a convenient information resource.
COMPONENT TESTING
Students will fi  nd clear descriptions of how to test 
 individual electronic components using  common 
equipment such as  digital multimeters (DMMs).Many things can go wrong with a transistor. Since it contains two diodes, 
exceeding any of the breakdown voltages, maximum currents, or power ratings 
can damage either or both diodes. The troubles may include shorts, opens, high 
leakage currents, and reduced /H9252dc.
Out-of-Circuit Tests
A transistor is commonly tested using a DMM set to the diode test range. 
Figure  6-28 shows how an npn transistor resembles two back-to-back diodes. 
Each pn junction can be tested for normal forward- and reverse-biased readings. 
The collector to emitter can also be tested and should result in an overrange in-
dication with either DMM polarity connection. Since a transistor has three leads, 
there are six DMM polarity connections possible. These are shown in Fig. 6-29 a. 
Notice that only two polarity connections result in approximately a 0.7 V reading. 
Also important to note here is that the base lead is the only connection common 
to both 0.7 V readings and it requires a (+) polarity connection. This is also shown 
in Fig. 6-29 b.
A pnp transistor can be tested using the same technique. As shown in 
Fig. 6-30, the pnp transistor also resembles two back-to-back diodes. Again, using 
the DMM in the diode test range, Fig. 6-31 a and 6-31 b show the results for a 
 normal tra nsistor./H11005CC

their basic characteristics and equations. 
12-12  MOSFET Testing
MOSFET devices require special care when being tested for proper operation. As 
stated previously, the thin layer of silicon dioxide between the gate and channel 
can be easily destroyed when VGS exceeds VGS(max). Because of the insulated gate, 
along with the channel construction, testing MOSFET devices with an ohmmeter 
or DMM is not very effective. A good way to test these devices is with a semicon-
ductor curve tracer. If a curve tracer is not available, special test circuits can be 
constructed. Figure 12-48 a shows a circuit capable of testing both depletion-mode 
and enhancement-mode MOSFETs. By changing the voltage level and  polarity of 
V1, the device can be tested in either depletion or enhancement modes of opera-

RLE-MOSFETsensitivity with a variable base return resistor (Fig. 7-8 b), but the base is usually 
left open to get maximum sensitivity to light.
The price paid for increased sensitivity is reduced speed. A phototran-
sistor is more sensitive than a photodiode, but it cannot turn on and off as fast. A 
 photodiode has typical output currents in microamperes and can switch on and off 
in nanoseconds. The phototransistor has typical output currents in milliamperes but 
switches on and off in microseconds. A typical phototransistor is shown in Fig. 7-8 c.
Optocoupler
Figure 7-9 a shows an LED driving a phototransistor. This is a much more sen-
sitive optocoupler than the LED-photodiode discussed earlier. The idea is straight-
forward. Any changes in VS produce changes in the LED current, which changes 
the current through the phototransistor. In turn, this produces a changing voltage 
across the collector-emitter terminals. Therefore, a signal voltage is coupled from 
the input circuit to the output circuit.
Again, the big advantage of an optocoupler is the electrical isolation 
 between the input and output circuits. Stated another way, the common for the 
input circuit is different from the common for the output circuit. Because of this, 
no conductive path exists between the two circuits. This means that you can 
ground one of the circuits and fl  oat the other. For instance, the input circuit can be 
grounded to the chassis of the equipment, while the common of the output side is 
ungrounded. Figure 7-9 b shows a typical optocoupler IC.

GOOD TO KNOW
The optocoupler was actu-
ally designed as a solid-state 
 replacement for a mechanical 
relay. Functionally, the opto-
coupler is similar to its older 
 mechanical counterpart be-
cause it offers a high degree of 
 isolation between its input and 
its output terminals. Some of the 
advantages of using an optocou-
pler versus a mechanical relay 
are faster operating speeds, no 
bouncing of contacts, smaller 
size, no moving parts to stick, 
and compatibility with digital 
 microprocessor circuits.xiv Guided Tour
Summary
SEC. 1-1   THE THREE KINDS OF 
FORMULAS
A deﬁ  nition  is a formula invented for 
a new concept. A law is a formula for 
a  relation in nature. A derivation  is a 
 formula produced with mathematics.
SEC. 1-2  APPROXIMATIONS
Approximations are widely used in 
the electronics industry. The ideal 
approximation is useful for trouble-
shooting. The second approximation 
is useful for preliminary circuit calcu-
lations. Higher approximations are 
used with computers.
SEC. 1-3  VOLTAGE SOURCES
An ideal voltage source has no inter-
nal  resistance. The second approxima-
tion of a voltage source has an internal 
 resistance in series with the source. A 
stiff  voltage source is deﬁ  ned as one 
whose internal resistance is less than 
1⁄100 of the load resistance.SEC. 1-4  CURRENT SOURCES
An ideal current source has an inﬁ  nite 
internal resistance. The second ap-
proximation of a current source has 
a large internal resistance in parallel 
with the source. A stiff  current source  
is deﬁ  ned as one whose internal re-
sistance is more than 100 times the 
load resistance.
SEC. 1-5  THEVENIN’S THEOREM
The Thevenin voltage  is deﬁ  ned as 
the voltage across an open load. The 
 Thevenin resistance  is deﬁ  ned as 
the resistance an ohmmeter would 
 measure with an open load and all 
sources  reduced to zero. Thevenin 
proved that a Thevenin equivalent 
circuit will produce the same load cur-
rent as any other  circuit with sources 
and linear resistances.
SEC. 1-6  NORTON’S THEOREM
The Norton resistance equals the 
 Thevenin resistance. The Norton current equals the load current 
when the load is shorted. Norton 
proved that a Norton equivalent cir-
cuit produces the same load voltage 
as any other circuit with sources and 
linear resistances. Norton current 
equals Thevenin voltage divided by 
Thevenin resistance.
SEC. 1-7  TROUBLESHOOTING
The most common troubles are 
shorts, opens, and intermittent trou-
bles. A short always has zero voltage 
across it; the current through a short 
must be calculated by examining 
the rest of the circuit. An open al-
ways has zero current through it; 
the voltage across an open must be 
calculated by examining the rest of 
the circuit. An intermittent trouble is 
an on-again, off  -again trouble that 
requires patient and logical trouble-
shooting to isolate it.

A formula  is a rule that relates quantities. The rule may be an equation, an in-
equality, or other mathematical description. You will see many formulas in 
this book. Unless you know why each one is true, you may become confused 
as they accumulate. Fortunately, there are only three ways formulas can come 
into  existence. Knowing what they are will make your study of electronics more 
 logical and satisfying.
The Deﬁ  nition
When you study electricity and electronics, you have to memorize new words like 
current, voltage,  and resistance.  However, a verbal explanation of these words is 
not enough. Why? Because your idea of current must be mathematically identical 
to everyone else’s. The only way to get this identity is with a defi nition,  a formula 
invented for a new concept.
 Here is an example of a defi  nition. In your earlier course work, you 
learned that capacitance equals the charge on one plate divided by the voltage 
 between plates. The formula looks like this:
C 5 Q __ V
This formula is a defi  nition. It tells you what capacitance C is and how to calcu-
late it. Historically, some researcher made up this defi  nition and it became widely 
accepted.
 Here is an example of how to create a new defi  nition out of thin air. 
Suppose we are doing research on reading skills and need some way to measure 
reading speed. Out of the blue, we might decide to defi  ne reading speed  as the 
number of words read in a minute. If the number of words is W and the number of 
minutes is M, we could make up a formula like this:
S 5 W__
M
In this equation, S is the speed measured in words per minute.
 To be fancy, we could use Greek letters: /H9275 for words, /H9262 for minutes, and 
/H9268 for speed. Our defi  nition would then look like this:
/H9268 5 /H9275__ /H9262 
This equation still translates to speed equals words divided by minutes. When you 
see an equation like this and know that it is a defi  nition, it is no longer as impres-
sive and mysterious as it initially appears to be.
 In summary, defi  nitions are formulas that a researcher creates.  They are 
based on scientifi  c observation and form the basis for the study of electronics. 
They are simply accepted as facts. It’s done all the time in science. A defi  nition is 
true in the same sense that a word is true. Each represents something we want to 
talk about. When you know which formulas are defi  nitions, electronics is easier 
to understand. Because defi  nitions are starting points, all you need to do is under-
stand and memorize them.
The Law
A law is different. It summarizes a relationship that already exists in nature. Here 
is an example of a law:
f 5 K   Q1Q2 _____ d2  GOOD TO KNOW
For all practical purposes, a 
 formula is like a set of instruc-
tions written in mathematical 
shorthand. A formula describes 
how to go about calculating a 
particular quantity or parameter.Introduction 5where f 5 force 
 K  5 a constant of proportionality, 9(109)
 Q 1 5 fi  rst charge
 Q 2 5 second charge
 d  5 distance between charges
This is Coulomb’s law. It says that the force of attraction or repulsion between 
two charges is directly proportional to the charges and inversely proportional to 
the square of the distance between them.
 This is an important equation, for it is the foundation of electricity. But 
where does it come from? And why is it true? To begin with, all the variables in 
this law existed before its discovery. Through experiments, Coulomb was able to 
prove that the force was directly proportional to each charge and inversely pro-
portional to the square of the distance between the charges. Coulomb’s law is an 
example of a relationship that exists in nature. Although earlier researchers could 
measure f, Q1, Q2, and d, Coulomb discovered the law relating the quantities and 
wrote a formula for it.
 Before discovering a law, someone may have a hunch that such a rela-
tionship exists. After a number of experiments, the researcher writes a formula 
that summarizes the discovery. When enough people confi  rm the discovery 
through experiments, the formula becomes a law. A law is true because you can 
verify it with an experiment.
The Derivation
Given an equation like this:
y 5 3x
we can add 5 to both sides to get:
y 1 5 5 3x 1 5
The new equation is true because both sides are still equal. There are many other 
operations like subtraction, multiplication, division, factoring, and substitution 
that preserve the equality of both sides of the equation. For this reason, we can 
 derive many new formulas using mathematics.
 A derivation  is a formula that we can get from other formulas.  This 
means that we start with one or more formulas and, using mathematics, arrive 
at a new formula not in our original set of formulas. A derivation is true because 
mathematics preserves the equality of both sides of every equation between the 
starting formula and the derived formula.
 For instance, Ohm was experimenting with conductors. He discovered 
that the ratio of voltage to current was a constant. He named this constant resis-
tance  and wrote the following formula for it:
R 5   V __ I  
This is the original form of Ohm’s law. By rearranging it, we can get:
I 5   V __ R  
This is a derivation. It is the original form of Ohm’s law converted to another 
equation.6 Chapter 1 Here is another example. The defi  nition for capacitance is:
C 5   Q __ V 
We can multiply both sides by V to get the following new equation:
Q 5 CV
This is a derivation. It says that the charge on a capacitor equals its capacitance 
times the voltage across it.
What to Remember
Why is a formula true? There are three possible answers. To build your under-
standing of electronics on solid ground, classify each new formula in one of these 
three categories:
Defi  nition: A formula invented for a new concept
Law:  A formula for a relationship in nature
Derivation:  A formula produced with mathematics
1-2 Approximations
We use approximations all the time in everyday life. If someone asks you how old 
you are, you might answer 21 (ideal). Or you might say 21 going on 22 (second 
approximation). Or, maybe, 21 years and 9 months (third approximation). Or, if 
you want to be more accurate, 21 years, 9 months, 2 days, 6 hours, 23 minutes, 
and 42 seconds (exact).
 The foregoing illustrates different levels of approximation: an ideal ap-
proximation, a second approximation, a third approximation, and an exact answer. 
The approximation to use will depend on the situation. The same is true in elec-
tronics work. In circuit analysis, we need to choose an approximation that fi  ts the 
situation.
The Ideal Approximation
Did you know that 1 foot of AWG 22 wire that is 1 inch from a chassis has a 
resistance of 0.016 V, an inductance of 0.24  /H9262H, and a capacitance of 3.3 pF? If 
we had to include the effects of resistance, inductance, and capacitance in every 
calculation for current, we would spend too much time on calculations. This is 
why everybody ignores the resistance, inductance, and capacitance of connecting 
wires in most situations.
 The ideal approximation,  sometimes called the fi rst approximation,  is 
the simplest equivalent circuit for a device. For instance, the ideal approximation 
of a piece of wire is a conductor of zero resistance. This ideal approximation is 
 adequate for everyday electronics work.
 The exception occurs at higher frequencies, where you have to con-
sider the inductance and capacitance of the wire. Suppose 1 inch of wire has an 
 inductance of 0.24 /H9262H and a capacitance of 3.3 pF. At 10 MHz, the inductive 
reactance is 15.1 V, and the capacitive reactance is 4.82 k V. As you see, a cir-
cuit designer can no longer idealize a piece of wire. Depending on the rest of 
the  circuit, the inductance and capacitive reactances of a connecting wire may 
be important.Introduction 7 As a guideline, we can idealize a piece of wire at frequencies under 
1 MHz. This is usually a safe rule of thumb. But it does not mean that you can 
be careless about wiring. In general, keep connecting wires as short as possible, 
 because at some point on the frequency scale, those wires will begin to degrade 
circuit performance.
 When you are troubleshooting, the ideal approximation is usually adequate 
because you are looking for large deviations from normal voltages and currents. In 
this book, we will idealize semiconductor devices by reducing them to simple equiv-
alent circuits. With ideal approximations, it is easier to analyze and understand how 
semiconductor circuits work.
The Second Approximation
The ideal approximation of a fl  ashlight battery is a voltage source of 1.5 V . The 
second approximation  adds one or more components to the ideal approximation. 
For instance, the second approximation of a fl  ashlight battery is a voltage source of 
1.5 V and a series resistance of 1 V. This series resistance is called the source  or 
internal  resistance of the battery. If the load resistance is less than 10  V, the load volt-
age will be noticeably less than 1.5 V because of the voltage drop across the source 
 resistance. In this case, accurate calculations must include the source resistance.
The Third Approximation and Beyond
The third approximation  includes another component in the equivalent circuit 
of the device. An example of the third approximation will be examined when we 
discuss semiconductor diodes.
 Even higher approximations are possible with many components in the 
equivalent circuit of a device. Hand calculations using these higher approxima-
tions can become diffi  cult and time consuming. Because of this, computers using 
circuit simulation software are often used. For instance, Multisim by National 
Instruments (NI) and PSpice are commercially available computer programs that 
use higher approximations to analyze and simulate semiconductor circuits. Many 
of the circuits and examples in this book can be analyzed and demonstrated using 
this type of software.
Conclusion
Which approximation to use depends on what you are trying to do. If you are 
troubleshooting, the ideal approximation is usually adequate. For many situations, 
the second approximation is the best choice because it is easy to use and does 
not require a computer. For higher approximations, you should use a computer 
and a program like Multisim. A Multisim tutorial can be found on the Instructor 
 Resources section of Connect for Electronic Principles .
1-3 Voltage Sources
An ideal dc voltage source  produces a load voltage that is constant. The sim-
plest example of an ideal dc voltage source is a perfect battery, one whose inter-
nal  resistance is zero. Figure 1-1 a shows an ideal voltage source connected to a 
 variable load resistance of 1 V to 10 M V. The voltmeter reads 10 V , exactly the 
same as the source voltage.
 Figure 1-1 b shows a graph of load voltage versus load resistance. As you 
can see, the load voltage remains fi  xed at 10 V when the load resistance changes 
from 1 V to 1 M V. In other words, an ideal dc voltage source produces a constant 
load voltage, regardless of how small or large the load resistance is. With an ideal 
voltage source, only the load current changes when the load resistance changes.8 Chapter 1Second Approximation
An ideal voltage source is a theoretical device; it cannot exist in nature. Why? 
When the load resistance approaches zero, the load current approaches infi  nity. 
No real voltage source can produce infi  nite current because a real voltage source 
always has some internal resistance. The second approximation of a dc voltage 
source includes this internal resistance.
 Figure 1-2 a illustrates the idea. A source resistance RS of 1 V is now in 
series with the ideal battery. The voltmeter reads 5 V when RL is 1 V. Why? Be-
cause the load current is 10 V divided by 2 V, or 5 A. When 5 A fl  ows through the 
source resistance of 1 V, it produces an internal voltage drop of 5 V . This is why 
the load voltage is only half of the ideal value, with the other half being dropped 
across the internal resistance.
 Figure 1-2 b shows the graph of load voltage versus load resistance. In 
this case, the load voltage does not come close to the ideal value until the load 
resistance is much greater than the source resistance. But what does much greater  
mean? In other words, when can we ignore the source resistance?Figure 1-1   (a) Ideal voltage source and variable load resistance; ( b) load voltage is constant for all load resistances.

Now is the time when a new defi  nition can be useful. So, let us invent one. We 
can ignore the source resistance when it is at least 100 times smaller than the load 
 resistance. Any source that satisfi  es this condition is a stiff voltage source.  As a 
 defi nition,
Stiff voltage source:  RS , 0.01RL (1-1)
This formula defi  nes what we mean by a stiff voltage source.  The boundary of the 
inequality (where  , is changed to 5) gives us the following equation:
RS 5 0.01RL
Solving for load resistance gives the minimum load resistance we can use and still 
have a stiff source:
RL(min) 5 100RS (1-2)
In words, the minimum load resistance equals 100 times the source resistance.
 Equation (1-2) is a derivation. We started with the defi  nition of a stiff 
voltage source and rearranged it to get the minimum load resistance permitted 
with a stiff voltage source. As long as the load resistance is greater than 100 RS, the 
voltage source is stiff. When the load resistance equals this worst-case value, the 
calculation error from ignoring the source resistance is 1 percent, small enough to 
ignore in a second approximation.
 Figure 1-3 visually summarizes a stiff voltage source. The load resis-
tance has to be greater than 100 RS for the voltage source to be stiff.Figure 1-3   Stiff   region occurs when load resistance is large enough.

GOOD TO KNOW
A well-regulated power supply is 
a good example of a stiff voltage 
source.
Example 1-1
The defi  nition of a stiff voltage source applies to ac sources as well as to dc 
sources. Suppose an ac voltage source has a source resistance of 50 V. For what 
load resistance is the source stiff?
SOLUTION   Multiply by 100 to get the minimum load resistance:
RL 5 100RS 5 100(50 V) 5 5 kV10 Chapter 11-4 Current Sources
A dc voltage source produces a constant load voltage for different load resis-
tances. A dc current source  is different. It produces a constant load current for 
different load resistances. An example of a dc current source is a battery with a 
large source resistance (Fig. 1-4 a). In this circuit, the source resistance is 1 M V
and the load current is:
IL 5   VS _______ RS 1 RL   
When RL is 1 V in Fig. 1-4 a, the load current is:
IL 5   10 V ____________   1 MV  1 1 V   5 10 /H9262A
In this calculation, the small load resistance has an insignifi  cant effect on the load 
current.
 Figure 1-4 b shows the effect of varying the load resistance from 1 V to 
1 MV. In this case, the load current remains constant at 10 /H9262A over a large range. 
It is only when the load resistance is greater than 10 k V that a noticeable drop-off 
occurs in load current.
As long as the load resistance is greater than 5 k V, the ac voltage source is stiff 
and we can ignore the internal resistance of the source.
 A fi  nal point. Using the second approximation for an ac voltage source 
is valid only at low frequencies. At high frequencies, additional factors such as 
lead inductance and stray capacitance come into play . We will deal with these 
high-frequency effects in a later chapter.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 1-1  If the ac source resistance in Example 1-1 is 
600 V, for what load resistance is the source stiff?
GOOD TO KNOW
At the output terminals of a 
constant current source, the 
load voltage VL increases in 
direct proportion to the load 
resistance.

Here is another defi  nition that will be useful, especially with semiconductor cir-
cuits. We will ignore the source resistance of a current source when it is at least 
100 times larger than the load resistance. Any source that satisfi  es this condition 
is a stiff current source.  As a defi  nition:
Stiff current source: RS . 100RL (1-3)
The upper boundary is the worst case. At this point:
RS 5 100RL
Solving for load resistance gives the maximum load resistance we can use and still 
have a stiff current source:
RL(max) 5 0.01RS (1-4)
In words: The maximum load resistance equals 1⁄100 of the source resistance.
 Equation (1-4) is a derivation because we started with the defi  nition of a 
stiff current source and rearranged it to get the maximum load resistance. When 
the load resistance equals this worst-case value, the calculation error is 1 percent, 
small enough to ignore in a second approximation.
 Figure 1-5 shows the stiff region. As long as the load resistance is less 
than 0.01 RS, the current source is stiff.
Schematic Symbol
Figure 1-6 a is the schematic symbol of an ideal current source, one whose source 
resistance is infi  nite. This ideal approximation cannot exist in nature, but it can 
exist mathematically. Therefore, we can use the ideal current source for fast  circuit 
analysis, as in troubleshooting.
 Figure 1-6 a is a visual defi  nition: It is the symbol for a current source. 
When you see this symbol, it means that the device produces a constant current IS. 
It may help to think of a current source as a pump that pushes out a fi  xed number 
of coulombs per second. This is why you will hear expressions like “The current 
source pumps 5 mA through a load resistance of 1 k V.”
 Figure 1-6 b shows the second approximation. The internal resistance 
is in parallel with the ideal current source, not in series as it was with an ideal 
 voltage source. Later in this chapter we will discuss Norton’s theorem. You will 
then see why the internal resistance must be in parallel with the current source. 
Summary Table 1-1 will help you understand the differences between a voltage 
source and a current source.

Example 1-2
A current source of 2 mA has an internal resistance of 10 M V. Over what range of load resistance is the current source stiff?
SOLUTION  Since this is a current source, the load resistance has to be small compared to the source resistance. With 
the 100:1 rule, the maximum load resistance is:
RL(max) 5 0.01(10 M V) 5 100 k V
The stiff range for the current source is a load resistance from 0 to 100 k V.
 Figure 1-7 summarizes the solution. In Fig. 1-7 a, a current source of 2 mA is in parallel with 10 M V and a variable 
resistor set to 1 V. The ammeter measures a load current of 2 mA. When the load resistance changes from 1 V to 1 M V, as 
shown in Fig. 1-7 b, the source remains stiff up to 100 k V. At this point, the load current is down about 1 percent from the 
ideal value. Stated another way, 99 percent of the source current passes through the load resistance. The other 1 percent passe s 
through the source resistance. As the load resistance continues to increase, load current continues to decrease.

Every once in a while, somebody makes a big breakthrough in engineering and 
carries all of us to a new high. A French engineer, M. L. Thevenin, made one of 
these quantum leaps when he derived the circuit theorem named after him: The-
venin’s theorem.
Deﬁ  nition of Thevenin Voltage and Resistance
A theorem  is a statement that we can prove mathematically. Because of this, it 
is not a defi  nition or a law. So, we classify it as a derivation. Recall the following 
ideas about Thevenin’s theorem from earlier courses. In Fig. 1-8 a, the Thevenin 
voltage  VTH is defi  ned as the voltage across the load terminals when the load 
 resistor is open. Because of this, the Thevenin voltage is sometimes called the 
open-circuit voltage.  As a defi  nition:
Thevenin voltage: VTH 5 VOC (1-5)
 The Thevenin resistance  is defi  ned as the resistance that an ohmmeter 
measures across the load terminals of Fig. 1-8 a when all sources are reduced to 
zero and the load resistor is open. As a defi  nition:
Thevenin resistance: RTH 5 ROC (1-6)
With these two defi  nitions, Thevenin was able to derive the famous theorem 
named after him.
 There is a subtle point in fi  nding the Thevenin resistance. Reducing a 
source to zero has different meanings for voltage and current sources. When you 
reduce a voltage source to zero, you are effectively replacing it with a short be-
cause that’s the only way to guarantee zero voltage when a current fl  ows through 
the voltage source. When you reduce a current source to zero, you are effectively 
 replacing it with an open because that’s the only way you can guarantee zero 
 current when there is a voltage across the current source. To summarize:
To zero a voltage source, replace it with a short.
To zero a current source, replace it with an open.
The Derivation
What is Thevenin’s theorem? Look at Fig. 1-8 a. This black box can contain 
any circuit with dc sources and linear resistances. (A linear resistance  does not 
change with increasing voltage.) Thevenin was able to prove that no matter how 
Application Example  1-3
When you analyze transistor circuits, you will visualize a transistor as a current 
source. In a well-designed circuit, the transistor will act like a stiff current source, 
so you can ignore its internal resistance. Then you can calculate the load  voltage. 
For instance, if a transistor is pumping 2 mA through a load resistance of 10 k V, 
the load voltage is 20 V .

exactly the same load current as the simple circuit of Fig. 1-8 b. As a derivation:
IL 5   VTH _________  RTH 1 RL   (1-7)
 Let the idea sink in. Thevenin’s theorem is a powerhouse tool. Engineers 
and technicians use the theorem constantly. Electronics could not possibly be 
where it is today without Thevenin’s theorem. It not only simplifi  es calculations, 
it enables us to explain circuit operation that would be impossible to explain with 
only Kirchhoff equations.
Example 1-4
What are the Thevenin voltage and resistance in Fig. 1-9 a?
SOLUTION  First, calculate the Thevenin voltage. To do this, you have to 
open the load resistor. Opening the load resistance is equivalent to removing it 
from the circuit, as shown in Fig. 1-9 b. Since 8 mA fl  ows through 6 k V in series 
with 3 k V, 24 V will appear across the 3 k V. With no current through the 4 k V, 
24 V will  appear across the AB terminals. Therefore:
VTH 5 24 V
 Second, get the Thevenin resistance. Reducing a dc source to zero is 
equivalent to replacing it with a short, as shown in Fig. 1-9 c. If we connect an 
ohmmeter across the AB terminals of Fig. 1-9 c, what will it read?
 It will read 6 k V. Why? Because looking back into the AB terminals with 
the battery shorted, the ohmmeter sees 4 k V in series with a parallel connection of 
3 kV and 6 k V. We can write:
RTH 5 4 kV 1   3 kV 3 6 kV  ___________   3 kV 1 6 kV   5 6 kV
The product over sum of 3 k V and 6 k V is 2 k V, which, added to 4 k V, gives 6 k V.
 Again, we need a new defi  nition. Parallel connections occur so often in 
electronics that most people use a shorthand notation for them. From now on, we 
will use the following notation:
i 5 in parallel with
Whenever you see two vertical bars in an equation, it means in parallel with. In 
the electronics industry, you will see the foregoing equation for Thevenin resist-
ance  written like this:
RTH 5 4 kV 1 (3 kV i 6 kV) 5 6 kV
Most engineers and technicians know that the vertical bars mean in  parallel with, 
so they automatically use product over sum or reciprocal method to calculate the 
equivalent resistance of 3 k V and 6 k V.

simple circuit with the original circuit of Fig. 1-9 a. Can you see how much easier Figure 1-9  (a) Original circuit;

Application Example  1-5
A breadboard  is a circuit often built with solderless connections without regard to 
the fi  nal location of parts to prove the feasibility of a design. Suppose you have the 
circuit of Fig. 1-11 a breadboarded on a lab bench. How would you measure the 
Thevenin voltage and resistance?
SOLUTION   Start by replacing the load resistor with a multimeter, as shown 
in Fig. 1-11 b. After you set the multimeter to read volts, it will indicate 9 V . This is 
the Thevenin voltage. Next, replace the dc source with a short (Fig. 1-11 c). Set the 
multimeter to read ohms, and it will indicate 1.5 k V. This is the Thevenin  resistance.
 Are there any sources of error in the foregoing measurements? Yes: The 
one thing to watch out for is the input impedance of the multimeter when voltage is 
measured. Because this input impedance is across the measured terminals, a small 
current fl  ows through the multimeter. For instance, if you use a moving-coil multi-
meter, the typical sensitivity is 20 k V per volt. On the 10-V range, the voltmeter 
has an input resistance of 200 k V. This will load the circuit down slightly and 
decrease the load voltage from 9 to 8.93 V .
 As a guideline, the input impedance of the voltmeter should be at least 
100 times greater than the Thevenin resistance. Then, the loading error is less 
than 1 percent. To avoid loading error, use a digital multimeter (DMM) instead 
of a moving-coil multimeter.  The input impedance of a DMM is at least 10 M V, 
which usually eliminates loading error. Loading error can also be produced when 
taking measurements with an oscilloscope. That is why in high-impedance cir-
cuits, a 10 3 probe should be used.

1-6 Norton’s Theorem
Recall the following ideas about Norton’s theorem from earlier courses. In 
Fig. 1-12 a, the Norton current IN is defi  ned as the load current when the load 
resistor is shorted. Because of this, the Norton current  is sometimes called the Introduction 17short- circuit c urrent.  As a defi  nition:
Norton current: IN 5 ISC (1-8)
 The Norton resistance  is the resistance that an ohmmeter measures 
across the load terminals when all sources are reduced to zero and the load resistor 
is open. As a defi  nition:
Norton resistance: RN 5 ROC (1-9)
Since Thevenin resistance also equals ROC, we can write:
RN 5 RTH (1-10)
This derivation says that Norton resistance equals Thevenin resistance. If you 
 calculate a Thevenin resistance of 10 k V, you immediately know that the Norton 
resistance equals 10 k V.
Basic Idea
What is Norton’s theorem? Look at Fig. 1-12 a. This black box can contain any 
 circuit with dc sources and linear resistances. Norton proved that the circuit inside 
the black box of Fig. 1-12 a would produce exactly the same load voltage as the 
simple circuit of Fig. 1-12 b. As a derivation, Norton’s theorem looks like this:
VL 5 IN(RN i RL) (1-11)
In words: The load voltage equals the Norton current times the Norton resistance 
in parallel with the load resistance.
 Earlier we saw that Norton resistance equals Thevenin resistance. But 
notice the difference in the location of the resistors: Thevenin resistance is always 
in series with a voltage source; Norton resistance is always in parallel with a cur-
rent source.
 Note:  If you are using electron fl  ow, keep the following in mind. In the 
electronics  industry, the arrow inside the current source is almost always drawn in 
the direction of conventional current. The exception is a current source drawn with 
a dashed arrow instead of a solid arrow. In this case, the source pumps  electrons 
in the  direction of the dashed arrow.
The Derivation
Norton’s theorem can be derived from the duality principle.  It states that for any 
theorem in electrical circuit analysis, there is a dual (opposite) theorem in which GOOD TO KNOW
Like Thevenin’s theorem, 
Norton’s theorem can be 
applied to ac circuits  containing 
inductors, capacitors, and 
resistors. For ac circuits, the 
Norton current IN is usually 
stated as a complex number 
in polar form, whereas the 
 Norton impedance ZN is usually 
 expressed as a complex number 
in rectangular form.

later, both equivalent circuits are useful. Sometimes, it is easier to use Thevenin. 
At other times, we use Norton. It depends on the specifi  c problem. Summary

Relationships Between Thevenin 
and Norton Circuits
We already know that the Thevenin and Norton resistances are equal in value but 
different in location: Thevenin resistance is in series with a voltage source, and 
Norton resistance is in parallel with a current source.
 We can derive two more relationships, as follows. We can convert any 
Thevenin circuit to a Norton circuit, as shown in Fig. 1-13 a. The proof is straightfor-
ward. Short the AB terminals of the Thevenin circuit, and you get the Norton current:

This derivation says that the Norton current equals the Thevenin voltage divided 
by the Thevenin resistance.
 Similarly, we can convert any Norton circuit to a Thevenin circuit, as 
shown in Fig. 1-13 b. The open-circuit voltage is:
VTH 5 INRN (1-13)
This derivation says that the Thevenin voltage equals the Norton current times the 
Norton resistance.
 Figure 1-13 summarizes the equations for converting either circuit into 
the other.
Example 1-6
Suppose that we have reduced a complicated circuit to the Thevenin circuit shown 
in Fig. 1-14 a. How can we convert this to a Norton circuit?

Figure 1-14 c shows the Norton circuit.
 Most engineers and technicians forget Eq. (1-12) soon after they leave 
school. But they always remember how to solve the same problem using Ohm’s 
law. Here is what they do. Look at Fig. 1-14 a. Visualize a short across the AB 
terminals, as shown in Fig. 1-14 b. The short-circuit current equals the Norton 
current:
IN 5   10 V _____ 2 kV   5 5 mA
This is the same result, but calculated with Ohm’s law applied to the Thevenin 
 circuit. Figure 1-15 summarizes the idea. This memory aid will help you calculate 
the Norton current, given the Thevenin circuit.20 Chapter 1

1-7 Troubleshooting
Troubleshooting  means fi  nding out why a circuit is not doing what it is supposed 
to do. The most common troubles are opens and shorts. Devices like transistors 
can become open or shorted in a number of ways. One way to destroy any transis-
tor is by exceeding its maximum-power rating.
 Resistors become open when their power dissipation is excessive. But 
you can get a shorted resistor indirectly as follows. During the stuffi  ng and sol-
dering of printed-circuit boards, an undesirable splash of solder may connect two 
nearby conducting lines. Known as a solder bridge,  this effectively shorts any 
 device between the two conducting lines. On the other hand, a poor solder con-
nection usually means no connection at all. This is known as a cold-solder joint  
and means that the device is open.
 Besides opens and shorts, anything is possible. For instance, temporar-
ily applying too much heat to a resistor may permanently change the resistance 
by several percent. If the value of resistance is critical, the circuit may not work 
properly after the heat shock.
 And then there is the troubleshooter’s nightmare: the intermittent trou-
ble. This kind of trouble is diffi  cult to isolate because it appears and disappears. 
It may be a cold-solder joint that alternately makes and breaks a contact, or a 
loose cable connector, or any similar trouble that causes on-again, off-again 
 operation.
An Open Device
Always remember these two facts about an open device:
The current through an open device is zero.
The voltage across it is unknown.
The fi  rst statement is true because an open device has infi  nite resistance. No 
 current can exist in an infi  nite resistance. The second statement is true because 
of Ohm’s law:
V 5 IR 5 (0)(`)Introduction 21In this equation, zero times infi  nity is mathematically indeterminate. You have to 
fi  gure out what the voltage is by looking at the rest of the circuit.
A Shorted Device
A shorted device is exactly the opposite. Always remember these two statements 
about a shorted device:
The voltage across a shorted device is zero.
The current through it is unknown.
The fi  rst statement is true because a shorted device has zero resistance. No voltage 
can exist across zero resistance. The second statement is true because of Ohm’s 
law:
I 5   V __ R   5   0 __ 0  
Zero divided by zero is mathematically meaningless. You have to fi  gure out what 
the current is by looking at the rest of the circuit.
Procedure
Normally, you measure voltages with respect to ground. From these measurements 
and your knowledge of basic electricity, you can usually deduce the trouble. After 
you have isolated a component as the top suspect, you can unsolder or disconnect 
the component and use an ohmmeter or other instrument for confi  rmation.
Normal Values
In Fig. 1-16, a stiff voltage divider consisting of R1 and R2 drives resistors R3 and 
R4 in series. Before you can troubleshoot this circuit, you have to know what the 
normal voltages are. The fi  rst thing to do, therefore, is to work out the values of VA
and VB. The fi  rst is the voltage between A and ground. The second is the voltage 
 between B and ground. Because R1 and R2 are much smaller than R3 and R4 (10 V
versus 100 k V), the stiff voltage at A is approximately 16 V . Furthermore, since 
R3 and R4 are equal, the voltage at B is approximately 13 V . When this circuit is 
 trouble free, you will measure 6 V between A and ground, and 3 V between B and 
ground. These two voltages are the fi  rst entry of Summary Table 1-3.
R1 Open
When R1 is open, what do you think happens to the voltages? Since no current can 
fl ow through the open R1, no current can fl  ow through R2. Ohm’s law tells us the 
voltage across R2 is zero. Therefore, VA 5 0 and VB 5 0, as shown in Summary 
Table 1-3 for R1 open.
R2 Open
When R2 is open, what happens to the voltages? Since no current can fl  ow through 
the open R2, the voltage at A is pulled up toward the supply voltage. Since R1 is 
much smaller than R3 and R4, the voltage at A is approximately 12 V . Since R3 and 
R4 are equal, the voltage at B becomes 6 V . This is why VA 5 12 V and VB 5 6 V , 
as shown in Summary Table 1-3 for an R2 open.Figure 1-16   Voltage divider

discussion.

If ground C is open, no current can pass through R2. This is equivalent to an open 
R2. This is why the trouble C open has VA 5 12 V and VB 5 6 V in Summary 
Table 1-3.
 You should work out all of the remaining entries in Summary Table 1-3, 
making sure that you understand why each voltage exists for the given trouble.Summary Table 1-3 Troubles and Clues

Example 1-7
In Fig. 1-16, you measure VA 5 0 and VB 5 0. What is the trouble?
SOLUTION  Look at Summary Table 1-3. As you can see, two troubles are 
possible: R1 open or R2 shorted. Both of these produce zero voltage at points A 
and B. To  isolate the trouble, you can disconnect R1 and measure it. If it measures 
open, you have found the trouble. If it measures OK, then R2 is the trouble.

measure VA 5 12 V and VB 5 6 V in Fig. 1-16?Introduction 23
Summary
SEC. 1-1   THE THREE KINDS OF 
FORMULAS
A deﬁ  nition  is a formula invented for 
a new concept. A law is a formula for 
a  relation in nature. A derivation  is a 
 formula produced with mathematics.
SEC. 1-2  APPROXIMATIONS
Approximations are widely used in 
the electronics industry. The ideal 
approximation is useful for trouble-
shooting. The second approximation 
is useful for preliminary circuit calcu-
lations. Higher approximations are 
used with computers.
SEC. 1-3  VOLTAGE SOURCES
An ideal voltage source has no inter-
nal  resistance. The second approxima-
tion of a voltage source has an internal 
 resistance in series with the source. A 
stiff  voltage source is deﬁ  ned as one 
whose internal resistance is less than 
1⁄100 of the load resistance.SEC. 1-4  CURRENT SOURCES
An ideal current source has an inﬁ  nite 
internal resistance. The second ap-
proximation of a current source has 
a large internal resistance in parallel 
with the source. A stiff  current source  
is deﬁ  ned as one whose internal re-
sistance is more than 100 times the 
load resistance.
SEC. 1-5  THEVENIN’S THEOREM
The Thevenin voltage  is deﬁ  ned as 
the voltage across an open load. The 
 Thevenin resistance  is deﬁ  ned as 
the resistance an ohmmeter would 
 measure with an open load and all 
sources  reduced to zero. Thevenin 
proved that a Thevenin equivalent 
circuit will produce the same load cur-
rent as any other  circuit with sources 
and linear resistances.
SEC. 1-6  NORTON’S THEOREM
The Norton resistance equals the 
 Thevenin resistance. The Norton current equals the load current 
when the load is shorted. Norton 
proved that a Norton equivalent cir-
cuit produces the same load voltage 
as any other circuit with sources and 
linear resistances. Norton current 
equals Thevenin voltage divided by 
Thevenin resistance.
SEC. 1-7  TROUBLESHOOTING
The most common troubles are 
shorts, opens, and intermittent trou-
bles. A short always has zero voltage 
across it; the current through a short 
must be calculated by examining 
the rest of the circuit. An open al-
ways has zero current through it; 
the voltage across an open must be 
calculated by examining the rest of 
the circuit. An intermittent trouble is 
an on-again, off  -again trouble that 
requires patient and logical trouble-
shooting to isolate it.

work, you ﬁ  rst have to study semiconductors: materials that are 
neither conductors nor insulators. Semiconductors contain some 
free electrons, but what makes them unusual is the presence 
of holes. In this chapter, you will learn about semiconductors, 
holes, and other related topics.

Copper is a good conductor. The reason is clear when we look at its atomic struc-
ture (Fig. 2-1). The nucleus of the atom contains 29 protons (positive charges). 
When a copper atom has a neutral charge, 29 electrons (negative charges) circle 
the nucleus like planets around the sun. The electrons travel in distinct orbits  (also 
called shells ). There are 2 electrons in the fi  rst orbit, 8 electrons in the second, 
18 in the third, and 1 in the outer orbit.
Stable Orbits
The positive nucleus of Fig. 2-1 attracts the planetary electrons. The reason why 
these electrons are not pulled into the nucleus is the centrifugal (outward) force 
created by their circular motion. This centrifugal force is exactly equal to the in-
ward pull of the nucleus, so the orbit is stable. The idea is similar to a satellite that 
orbits the earth. At the right speed and height, a satellite can remain in a stable 
orbit above the earth.
 The larger the orbit of an electron, the smaller the attraction of the nu-
cleus. In a larger orbit, an electron travels more slowly, producing less centrifu-
gal force. The outermost electron in Fig. 2-1 travels slowly and feels almost no 
 attraction to the nucleus.
The Core
In electronics, all that matters is the outer orbit. It is called the valence orbit.  This 
orbit controls the electrical properties of the atom. To emphasize the importance 
of the valence orbit, we defi  ne the core of an atom as the nucleus and all the 
inner  orbits. For a copper atom, the core is the nucleus ( 129), and the fi  rst 
three orbits ( 228).
 The core of a copper atom has a net charge of 11 because it contains 
29 protons and 28 inner electrons. Figure 2-2 can help in visualizing the core and 
the valence orbit. The valence electron is in a large orbit around a core that has a 
net charge of only 11. Because of this, the inward pull felt by the valence electron 
is very small.

Example 2-1
Suppose an outside force removes the valence electron of Fig. 2-2 from a copper 
atom. What is the net charge of the copper atom? What is the net charge if an 
outside electron moves into the valence orbit of Fig. 2-2?
SOLUTION   When the valence electron leaves, the net charge of the atom 
 becomes 11. Whenever an atom loses one of its electrons, it becomes positively 
charged. We call a positively charged atom a positive ion.
 When an outside electron moves into the valence orbit of Fig. 2-2, the 
net charge of the atom becomes 21. Whenever an atom has an extra electron in its 
valence orbit, we call the negatively charged atom a negative ion.Free Electron
Since the attraction between the core and the valence electron is weak, an outside 
force can easily dislodge this electron from the copper atom. This is why we often 
call the valence electron a free electron.  This is also why copper is a good con-
ductor. The slightest voltage causes the free electrons to fl  ow from one atom to 
the next. The best conductors are silver, copper, and gold. All have a core diagram 
like Fig. 2-2.
2-2 Semiconductors
The best conductors (silver, copper, and gold) have one valence electron, 
whereas the best insulators have eight valence electrons. A semiconductor  is 
an element  with electrical properties between those of a conductor and those of 
an  insulator. As you might expect, the best semiconductors have four valence 
electrons.
Germanium
Germanium is an example of a semiconductor. It has four electrons in the va-
lence orbit. Many years ago, germanium was the only material suitable for mak-
ing semiconductor devices. But these germanium devices had a fatal fl  aw (their 
 excessive reverse current, discussed in a later section) that engineers could not 
overcome. Eventually, another semiconductor named silicon  became practical 
and made germanium obsolete in most electronic applications.
Silicon
Next to oxygen, silicon is the most abundant element on the earth. But there were 
certain refi  ning problems that prevented the use of silicon in the early days of 
semiconductors. Once these problems were solved, the advantages of silicon (dis-
cussed later) immediately made it the semiconductor of choice. Without it, mod-
ern electronics, communications, and computers would be impossible.32 Chapter 2/H11546

GOOD TO KNOW
Another common semiconductor 
element is carbon (C), which is 
used mainly in the production of 
resistors.
Example 2-2
What is the net charge of the silicon atom in Fig. 2-3 b if it loses one of its  valence 
electrons? If it gains an extra electron in the valence orbit?
SOLUTION   If it loses an electron, it becomes a positive ion with a charge  of 
11. If it gains an extra electron, it becomes a negative ion with a  charge of 21. An isolated silicon atom has 14 protons and 14 electrons. As shown in 
Fig. 2-3 a, the fi  rst orbit contains two electrons and the second orbit contains eight 
electrons. The four remaining electrons are in the valence orbit. In Fig. 2-3 a, the 
core has a net charge of 14 because it contains 14 protons in the nucleus and 
10 electrons in the fi  rst two orbits.
 Figure 2-3 b shows the core diagram of a silicon atom. The four valence 
electrons tell us that silicon is a semiconductor.
2-3 Silicon Crystals
When silicon atoms combine to form a solid, they arrange themselves into an 
 orderly pattern called a crystal.  Each silicon atom shares its electrons with four 
neighboring atoms in such a way as to have eight electrons in its valence orbit. For 
instance, Fig. 2-4 a shows a central atom with four neighbors. The shaded circles 
represent the silicon cores. Although the central atom originally had four electrons 
in its valence orbit, it now has eight.Semiconductors 33(a)( b)/H11549 /H11549/H11549 /H11549Figure 2-4   (a) Atom in crystal has four neighbors; ( b) covalent bonds.
Covalent Bonds
Each neighboring atom shares an electron with the central atom. In this way, the 
central atom has four additional electrons, giving it a total of eight electrons in 
the valence orbit. The electrons no longer belong to any single atom. Each cen-
tral atom and its neighbors share the electrons. The same idea is true for all the 
other silicon atoms. In other words, every atom inside a silicon crystal has four 
 neighbors.
 In Fig. 2-4 a, each core has a charge of 14. Look at the central core and 
the one to its right. These two cores attract the pair of electrons between them 
with equal and opposite force. This pulling in opposite directions is what holds the 
 silicon atoms together. The idea is similar to tug-of-war teams pulling on a rope. 
As long as both teams pull with equal and opposite force, they remain bonded 
 together.
 Since each shared electron in Fig. 2-4 a is being pulled in opposite direc-
tions, the electron becomes a bond between the opposite cores. We call this type 
of chemical bond a covalent bond.  Figure 2-4 b is a simpler way to show the con-
cept of the covalent bonds. In a silicon crystal, there are billions of silicon atoms, 
each with eight valence electrons. These valence electrons are the covalent bonds 
that hold the crystal together—that give it solidity.
Valence Saturation
Each atom in a silicon crystal has eight electrons in its valence orbit. These eight 
electrons produce a chemical stability that results in a solid piece of silicon mate-
rial. No one is quite sure why the outer orbit of all elements has a predisposition 
toward having eight electrons. When eight electrons do not exist naturally in an 
element, there seems to be a tendency for the element to combine and share elec-
trons with other atoms so as to have eight electrons in the outer orbit.
 There are advanced equations in physics that partially explain why eight 
electrons produce chemical stability in different materials, but no one knows the 
reason why the number eight is so special. It is one of those laws like the law of 
gravity, Coulomb’s law, and other laws that we observe but cannot fully explain.
 When the valence orbit has eight electrons, it is saturated  because no 
more electrons can fi  t into this orbit. Stated as a law:
Valence saturation: n 5 8 (2-1)
In words, the valence orbit can hold no more than eight electrons.  Furthermore, 
the eight valence electrons are called bound electrons  because they are tightly 34 Chapter 2GOOD TO KNOW
A hole and an electron each 
 possess a charge of 0.16 3 10218 C, 
but of opposite polarity.
(a)
(b)Figure 2-5   (a) Thermal energy

(b) recombination of free electron 
and hole.held by the atoms. Because of these bound electrons, a silicon crystal is almost a 
perfect insulator at room temperature, approximately 25°C.
The Hole
The ambient temperature  is the temperature of the surrounding air. When the 
ambient temperature is above absolute zero ( 2273°C), the heat energy in this air 
causes the atoms in a silicon crystal to vibrate. The higher the ambient tempera-
ture, the stronger the mechanical vibrations become. When you pick up a warm 
object, the warmth you feel is the effect of the vibrating atoms.
 In a silicon crystal, the vibrations of the atoms can occasionally dislodge 
an electron from the valence orbit. When this happens, the released electron gains 
enough energy to go into a larger orbit, as shown in Fig. 2-5 a. In this larger orbit, 
the electron is a free electron.
 But that’s not all. The departure of the electron creates a vacancy in the 
valence orbit called a hole (see Fig. 2-5 a). This hole behaves like a positive charge 
because the loss of the electron produces a positive ion. The hole will attract and 
capture any electron in the immediate vicinity. The existence of holes is the criti-
cal difference between conductors and semiconductors. Holes enable semicon-
ductors to do all kinds of things that are impossible with conductors.
 At room temperature, thermal energy produces only a few holes and free 
electrons. To increase the number of holes and free electrons, it is necessary to 
dope  the crystal. More is said about this in a later section.
Recombination and Lifetime
In a pure silicon crystal, thermal  (heat) energy  creates an equal number of free 
electrons and holes. The free electrons move randomly throughout the crystal. 
 Occasionally, a free electron will approach a hole, feel its attraction, and fall into 
it.  Recombination  is the merging of a free electron and a hole (see Fig. 2-5 b).
 The amount of time between the creation and disappearance of a free 
electron is called the lifetime.  It varies from a few nanoseconds to several micro-
seconds, depending on how perfect the crystal is and other factors.
Main Ideas
At any instant, the following is taking place inside a silicon crystal: 
1. Some free electrons and holes are being created by thermal energy.
2. Other free electrons and holes are recombining.
3. Some free electrons and holes exist temporarily, awaiting 
recombination.
Example 2-3
If a pure silicon crystal has 1 million free electrons inside it, how many holes does 
it have? What happens to the number of free electrons and holes if the ambient 
temperature increases?
SOLUTION   Look at Fig. 2-5 a. When heat energy creates a free electron, it 
automatically creates a hole at the same time. Therefore, a pure silicon crystal Semiconductors 35
always has the same number of holes and free electrons. If there are 1 million free 
electrons, there are 1 million holes.
 A higher temperature increases the vibrations at the atomic level, 
which means that more free electrons and holes are created. But no matter what 
the temperature is, a pure silicon crystal has the same number of free electrons 
and holes.

An intrinsic semiconductor  is a pure semiconductor. A silicon crystal is an 
 intrinsic semiconductor if every atom in the crystal is a silicon atom. At room 
temperature, a silicon crystal acts like an insulator because it has only a few free 
electrons and holes produced by thermal energy.
Flow of Free Electrons
Figure 2-6 shows part of a silicon crystal between charged metallic plates. As-
sume that thermal energy has produced a free electron and a hole. The free elec-
tron is in a large orbit at the right end of the crystal. Because of the negatively 
charged plate, the free electron is repelled to the left. This free electron can move 
from one large orbit to the next until it reaches the positive plate.
Flow of Holes
Notice the hole at the left of Fig. 2-6. This hole attracts the valence electron at 
point A. This causes the valence electron to move into the hole.
 When the valence electron at point A moves to the left, it creates a new 
hole at point A. The effect is the same as moving the original hole to the right. The 
new hole at point A can then attract and capture another valence electron. In this 
way, valence electrons can travel along the path shown by the arrows. This means 
the hole can move the opposite way, along path A-B-C-D-E-F , acting the same as
a positive charge.36 Chapter 2/H11001/H11001/H11001/H11001/H11001/H11001/H11001/H11002/H11002/H11002/H11002/H11002/H11002/H11002

(b)Figure 2-8  (a) Doping to get more 
free electrons; ( b) doping to get more

Figure 2-7 shows an intrinsic semiconductor. It has the same number of free elec-
trons and holes. This is because thermal energy produces free electrons and holes 
in pairs.  The applied voltage will force the free electrons to fl  ow left and the holes 
to fl  ow right. When the free electrons arrive at the left end of the crystal, they enter 
the external wire and fl  ow to the positive battery terminal.
 On the other hand, the free electrons at the negative battery terminal will 
fl ow to the right end of the crystal. At this point, they enter the crystal and recom-
bine with holes that arrive at the right end of the crystal. In this way, a steady fl  ow 
of free electrons and holes occurs inside the semiconductor. Note that there is no 
hole fl  ow outside the semiconductor.
 In Fig. 2-7, the free electrons and holes move in opposite directions.  From 
now on, we will visualize the current in a semiconductor as the combined effect 
of the two types of fl  ow: the fl  ow of free electrons in one direction and the fl  ow 
of holes in the other direction. Free electrons and holes are often called  carriers  
because they carry a charge from one place to another.
2-6 Doping a Semiconductor
One way to increase conductivity of a semiconductor is by doping.  This means 
adding impurity atoms to an intrinsic crystal to alter its electrical conductivity. 
A doped semiconductor is called an extrinsic semiconductor.
Increasing the Free Electrons
How does a manufacturer dope a silicon crystal? The fi  rst step is to melt a pure 
silicon crystal. This breaks the covalent bonds and changes the silicon from a 
solid to a liquid. To increase the number of free electrons, pentavalent atoms  are 
added to the molten silicon. Pentavalent atoms have fi  ve electrons in the valence 
orbit. Examples of pentavalent atoms include arsenic, antimony, and phosphorus. 
 Because these materials will donate an extra electron  to the silicon crystal, they 
are often referred to as donor impurities.
 Figure 2-8 a shows how the doped silicon crystal appears after it cools 
down and re-forms its solid crystal structure. A pentavalent atom is in the cen-
ter, surrounded by four silicon atoms. As before, the neighboring atoms share an 
electron with the central atom. But this time, there is an extra electron left over. 
 Remember that each pentavalent atom has fi  ve valence electrons. Since only eight 
electrons can fi  t into the valence orbit, the extra electron remains in a larger orbit. 
In other words, it is a free electron.
 Each pentavalent or donor atom in a silicon crystal produces one free 
electron.  This is how a manufacturer controls the conductivity of a doped semi-
conductor. The more impurity that is added, the greater the conductivity. In this 
way, a semiconductor may be lightly or heavily doped. A lightly doped semicon-
ductor has a high resistance, whereas a heavily doped semiconductor has a low 
 resistance.
Increasing the Number of Holes
How can we dope a pure silicon crystal to get an excess of holes? By using a 
 trivalent impurity,  one whose atoms have only three valence electrons. Examples 
 include aluminum, boron, and gallium.
 Figure 2-8 b shows a trivalent atom in the center. It is surrounded by 
four silicon atoms, each sharing one of its valence electrons. Since the trivalent Semiconductors 37/H11001/H11001/H11001/H11002/H11002/H11002/H11002/H11002/H11002/H11002

–+Figure 2-9  n-type semiconductor 
has many free electrons.
Example 2-4
A doped semiconductor has 10 billion silicon atoms and 15 million pentavalent 
atoms. If the ambient temperature is 25°C, how many free electrons and holes are 
there inside the semiconductor?
SOLUTION   Each pentavalent atom contributes one free electron. Therefore, 
the semiconductor has 15 million free electrons produced by doping. There will 
be almost no holes by comparison because the only holes in the semiconductor are 
those produced by heat energy.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 2-4   As in Example 2-4, if 5 million trivalent 
atoms are added instead of pentavalent atoms, how many holes are there inside 
the semiconductor?atom originally had only three valence electrons and each neighbor shares one 
 electron, only seven electrons are in the valence orbit. This means that a hole 
 exists in the valence orbit of each trivalent atom. A trivalent atom is also called an 
acceptor atom  because each hole it contributes can accept a free electron  during 
recombination.
Points to Remember
Before manufacturers can dope a semiconductor, they must produce it as a pure 
crystal. Then, by controlling the amount of impurity, they can precisely control 
the properties of the semiconductor. Historically, pure germanium crystals were 
easier to produce than pure silicon crystals. This is why the earliest semicon-
ductor devices were made of germanium. Eventually, manufacturing techniques 
 improved and pure silicon crystals became available. Because of its advantages, 
silicon has become the most popular and useful semiconductor material.
2-7  Two Types of 
Extrinsic Semiconductors
A semiconductor can be doped to have an excess of free electrons or an excess of 
holes. Because of this, there are two types of doped semiconductors.
n-Type Semiconductor
Silicon that has been doped with a pentavalent impurity is called an n-type semi-
conductor,  where the n stands for negative. Figure 2-9 shows an n-type semicon-
ductor. Since the free electrons outnumber the holes in an n-type semiconductor, 
the free electrons are called the majority carriers  and the holes are called the 
 minority carriers.
 Because of the applied voltage, the free electrons move to the left  and the 
holes move to the right . When a hole arrives at the right end of the crystal, one of 
the free electrons from the external circuit enters the semiconductor and recom-
bines with the hole.38 Chapter 2/H11001

has many holes. The free electrons shown in Fig. 2-9 fl  ow to the left end of the crystal, 
where they enter the wire and fl  ow on to the positive terminal of the battery.
p-Type Semiconductor
Silicon that has been doped with a trivalent impurity is called a p-type semicon-
ductor,  where the p stands for positive. Figure 2-10 shows a p-type semiconduc-
tor. Since holes outnumber free electrons, the holes are referred to as the majority 
carriers and the free electrons are known as the minority carriers.
 Because of the applied voltage, the free electrons move to the left  and 
the holes move to the right.  In Fig. 2-10, the holes arriving at the right end of the 
crystal will recombine with free electrons from the external circuit.
 There is also a fl  ow of minority carriers in Fig. 2-10. The free electrons 
inside the semiconductor fl  ow from right to left. Because there are so few minor-
ity carriers, they have almost no effect in this circuit.
2-8 The Unbiased Diode
By itself, a piece of n-type semiconductor is about as useful as a carbon resistor; 
the same can be said for a p-type semiconductor. But when a manufacturer dopes 
a crystal so that one-half of it is p-type and the other half is n-type, something new 
comes into existence.
 The border between p-type and n-type is called the pn junction.  The pn 
junction has led to all kinds of inventions, including diodes, transistors, and inte-
grated circuits. Understanding the pn junction enables you to understand all kinds 
of semiconductor devices.
The Unbiased Diode
As discussed in the preceding section, each trivalent atom in a doped silicon crys-
tal produces one hole. For this reason, we can visualize a piece of p-type semi-
conductor as shown on the left side of Fig. 2-11. Each circled minus sign is the 
trivalent atom, and each plus sign is the hole in its valence orbit.
 Similarly, we can visualize the pentavalent atoms and free electrons of 
an n-type semiconductor as shown on the right side of Fig. 2-11. Each circled plus 
sign represents a pentavalent atom, and each minus sign is the free electron it con-
tributes to the semiconductor. Notice that each piece of semiconductor material is 
electrically neutral because the number of pluses and minuses is equal.
 A manufacturer can produce a single crystal with p-type material on one 
side and n-type on the other side, as shown in Fig. 2-12. The junction is the bor-
der where the p-type and the n-type regions meet, and junction diode  is another 
name for a pn crystal. The word diode  is a contraction of two electrodes, where di 
stands for “two.”Semiconductors 39/H11001

(b)Figure 2-13  (a) Creation of ions at junction; ( b) depletion layer.The Depletion Layer
Because of their repulsion for each other, the free electrons on the n side of Fig. 2-12 
tend to diffuse (spread) in all directions. Some of the free electrons diffuse across 
the junction. When a free electron enters the p region, it becomes a minority car-
rier. With so many holes around it, this minority carrier has a short lifetime. Soon 
after entering the p region, the free electron recombines with a hole. When this 
happens, the hole disappears  and the free electron becomes a valence electron.
 Each time an electron diffuses across a junction, it creates a pair of ions. 
When an electron leaves the n side, it leaves behind a pentavalent atom that is 
short one negative charge; this pentavalent atom becomes a positive ion. After the 
migrating electron falls into a hole on the p side, it makes a negative ion out of the 
trivalent atom that captures it.
 Figure 2-13 a shows these ions on each side of the junction. The circled 
plus signs are the positive ions, and the circled minus signs are the negative ions. 
The ions are fi  xed in the crystal structure because of covalent bonding, and they 
cannot move around like free electrons and holes.
 Each pair of positive and negative ions at the junction is called a dipole.
The creation of a dipole means that one free electron and one hole have been taken 
out of circulation. As the number of dipoles builds up, the region near the junction 
is emptied of carriers. We call this charge-empty region the depletion layer  (see
Fig. 2-13 b).
Barrier Potential
Each dipole has an electric fi  eld between the positive and negative ions. There-
fore, if additional free electrons enter the depletion layer, the electric fi  eld tries 
to push these electrons back into the n region. The strength of the electric fi  eld 
increases with each crossing electron until equilibrium is reached. To a fi  rst ap-
proximation, this means that the electric fi  eld eventually stops the diffusion of 
 electrons across the junction.40 Chapter 2 In Fig. 2-13 a, the electric fi  eld between the ions is equivalent to a dif-
ference of potential called the barrier potential.  At 25°C, the barrier potential 
equals approximately 0.3 V for germanium diodes and 0.7 V for silicon diodes.
2-9 Forward Bias
Figure 2-14 shows a dc source across a diode. The negative source terminal is con-
nected to the n-type material, and the positive terminal is connected to the p-type 
material. This connection produces what is called forward bias.
Flow of Free Electrons
In Fig. 2-14, the battery pushes holes and free electrons toward the junction. If 
the battery voltage is less than the barrier potential, the free electrons do not have 
enough energy to get through the depletion layer. When they enter the depletion 
layer, the ions will push them back into the n region. Because of this, there is no 
current through the diode.
 When the dc voltage source is greater than the barrier potential, the bat-
tery again pushes holes and free electrons toward the junction. This time, the free 
electrons have enough energy to pass through the depletion layer and recombine 
with the holes. If you visualize all the holes in the p region moving to the right and 
all the free electrons moving to the left, you will have the basic idea. Somewhere 
in the vicinity of the junction, these opposite charges recombine. Since free elec-
trons continuously enter the right end of the diode and holes are being continu-
ously created at the left end, there is a continuous current through the diode.
The Flow of One Electron
Let us follow a single electron through the entire circuit. After the free electron 
leaves the negative terminal of the battery, it enters the right end of the diode. It 
travels through the n region until it reaches the junction. When the battery voltage 
is greater than 0.7 V , the free electron has enough energy to get across the deple-
tion layer. Soon after the free electron has entered the p region, it recombines with 
a hole.
 In other words, the free electron becomes a valence electron. As a  valence 
electron, it continues to travel to the left, passing from one hole to the next until 
it reaches the left end of the diode. When it leaves the left end of the diode, a new 
hole appears and the process begins again. Since there are billions of electrons 
taking the same journey, we get a continuous current through the diode. A series 
resistor is used to limit the amount of forward current.

+Figure 2-16  (a) Depletion layer; ( b) increasing reverse bias widens depletion layer.What to Remember
Current fl  ows easily in a forward-biased diode. As long as the applied voltage is 
greater than the barrier potential, there will be a large continuous current in the 
circuit. In other words, if the source voltage is greater than 0.7 V , a silicon diode 
allows a continuous current in the forward direction.
2-10  Reverse Bias
Turn the dc source around and you get Fig. 2-15. This time, the negative battery 
terminal is connected to the p side and the positive battery terminal to the n side. 
This connection produces what is called reverse bias.
Depletion Layer Widens
The negative battery terminal attracts the holes, and the positive battery terminal 
attracts the free electrons. Because of this, holes and free electrons fl  ow away 
from the junction. Therefore, the depletion layer gets wider.
 How wide does the depletion layer get in Fig. 2-16 a? When the holes 
and electrons move away from the junction, the newly created ions increase the 
difference of potential across the depletion layer. The wider the depletion layer, 
the greater the difference of potential. The depletion layer stops growing when 
its difference of potential equals the applied reverse voltage. When this happens, 
electrons and holes stop moving away from the junction./H11001

+Figure 2-17  Thermal production of free electron and hole in depletion layer 
produces reverse minority-saturation current.
 Sometimes the depletion layer is shown as a shaded region like that of 
Fig. 2-16 b. The width of this shaded region is proportional to the reverse voltage. 
As the reverse voltage increases, the depletion layer gets wider.
Minority-Carrier Current
Is there any current after the depletion layer stabilizes? Yes. A small current exists 
with reverse bias. Recall that thermal energy continuously creates pairs of free 
electrons and holes. This means that a few minority carriers exist on both sides of 
the junction. Most of these recombine with the majority carriers. But those inside 
the depletion layer may exist long enough to get across the junction. When this 
happens, a small current fl  ows in the external circuit.
 Figure 2-17 illustrates the idea. Assume that thermal energy has created a 
free electron and hole near the junction. The depletion layer pushes the free elec-
tron to the right, forcing one electron to leave the right end of the crystal. The hole 
in the depletion layer is pushed to the left. This extra hole on the p side lets one 
electron enter the left end of the crystal and fall into a hole. Since thermal energy 
is continuously producing electron-hole pairs inside the depletion layer, a small 
continuous current fl  ows in the external circuit.
 The reverse current caused by the thermally produced minority carriers 
is called the saturation current.  In equations, the saturation current is symbol-
ized by IS. The name saturation  means that we cannot get more minority-carrier 
current than is produced by the thermal energy. In other words, increasing the 
 reverse voltage will not increase the number of thermally created minority 
carriers.
Surface-Leakage Current
Besides the thermally produced minority-carrier current, does any other current 
exist in a reverse-biased diode? Yes. A small current fl  ows on the surface of the 
crystal. Known as the surface-leakage current,  it is caused by surface impurities 
and imperfections in the crystal structure.
What to Remember
The reverse current in a diode consists of a minority-carrier current and a 
surface-leakage current. In most applications, the reverse current in a silicon 
diode is so small that you don’t even notice it. The main idea to remember is this: 
Current is approximately zero in a reverse-biased silicon diode.Semiconductors 43Vpn/H11002/H11001

2, 4, 8,  . . . GOOD TO KNOW
Exceeding the breakdown volt-
age of a diode does not neces-
sarily mean that you will destroy 
the diode. As long as the 
product of reverse voltage and 
reverse current does not exceed 
the diode’s power rating, the 
diode will recover fully.2-11 Breakdown
Diodes have maximum voltage ratings. There is a limit to how much reverse volt-
age a diode can withstand before it is destroyed. If you continue increasing the 
 reverse voltage, you will eventually reach the breakdown voltage  of the diode. 
For many diodes, breakdown voltage is at least 50 V . The breakdown voltage is 
shown on the data sheet  for the diode. A data sheet, produced by the manufacturer 
of the diode, lists important information and typical applications for the device.
 Once the breakdown voltage is reached, a large number of the minority 
carriers suddenly appears in the depletion layer and the diode conducts heavily.
 Where do the carriers come from? They are produced by the avalanche ef-
fect (see Fig. 2-18), which occurs at higher reverse voltages. Here is what happens. 
As usual, there is a small reverse minority-carrier current. When the reverse voltage 
increases, it forces the minority carriers to move more quickly. These  minority car-
riers collide with the atoms of the crystal. When these minority carriers have enough 
energy, they can knock valence electrons loose, producing free electrons. These new 
minority carriers then join the existing minority carriers to  collide with other atoms. 
The process is geometric because one free electron  liberates one valence electron to 
get two free electrons. These two free electrons then free two more electrons to get 
four free electrons. The process continues until the  reverse current becomes huge.
 Figure 2-19 shows a magnifi  ed view of the depletion layer. The reverse 
bias forces the free electron to move to the right. As it moves, the electron gains 
speed. The larger the reverse bias, the faster the electron moves. If the high-speed 
electron has enough energy, it can bump the valence electron of the fi  rst atom into 
a larger orbit. This results in two free electrons. Both of these then accelerate and 
go on to dislodge two more electrons. In this way, the number of minority carriers 
may become quite large and the diode can conduct heavily.
 The breakdown voltage of a diode depends on how heavily doped the 
diode is. With rectifi  er diodes (the most common type), the breakdown voltage is 
usually greater than 50 V . Summary Table 2-1 illustrates the difference between a 
forward- and reverse-biased diode.
2-12  Energy Levels
We can identify the total energy of an electron with the size of its orbit to a good 
approximation. That is, we can think of each radius of Fig. 2-20 a as equivalent to 
an energy level in Fig. 2-20 b. Electrons in the smallest orbit are on the fi  rst energy 
level; electrons in the second orbit are on the second energy level; and so on.
Higher Energy in Larger Orbit
Since an electron is attracted by the nucleus, extra energy is needed to lift an 
electron into a larger orbit. When an electron is moved from the fi  rst to the second 
orbit, it gains potential energy with respect to the nucleus. Some of the external 
forces that can lift an electron to higher energy levels are heat, light, and voltage.44 Chapter 2Vs polarity ( 1) to P material

proportional to orbit size. ( a) Orbits; 
(b) energy levels. For instance, assume that an outside force lifts the electron from the fi  rst 
orbit to the second in Fig. 2-20 a. This electron has more potential energy because 
it is farther from the nucleus (Fig. 2-20 b). It is like an object above the earth: 
The higher the object, the greater its potential energy with respect to the earth. If 
 released, the object falls farther and does more work when it hits the earth.
Falling Electrons Radiate Light
After an electron has moved into a larger orbit, it may fall back to a lower energy 
level. If it does, it will give up its extra energy in the form of heat, light, and other 
radiation.
 In a light-emitting diode (LED),  the applied voltage lifts the electrons to 
higher energy levels. When these electrons fall back to lower energy levels, they 
give off light. Depending on the material used, the radiated light can be a variety 
of colors, including red, green, orange, or blue. Some LEDs produce infrared 
radiation (invisible), which is useful in burglar alarm systems.
Energy Bands
When a silicon atom is isolated, the orbit of an electron is infl  uenced only by 
the charges of the isolated atom. This results in energy levels like the lines of  
Fig. 2-20 b. But when silicon atoms are in a crystal, the orbit of each electron is 
also infl  uenced by the charges of many other silicon atoms. Since each electron 
has a unique position inside the crystal, no two electrons see exactly the same pat-
tern of surrounding charges. Because of this, the orbit of each electron is different; 
or, to put it another way, the energy level of each electron is different.
 Figure 2-21 shows what happens to the energy levels. All electrons in the  
fi rst orbit have slightly different energy levels because no two electrons see  exactly 
the same charge environment. Since there are billions of fi  rst-orbit electrons, the 
slightly different energy levels form a cluster, or band , of energy. Similarly, the 
billions of second-orbit electrons, all with slightly different energy levels, form 
the second energy band—and so on for remaining bands.Semiconductors 45 Another point: As you know, thermal energy produces a few free elec-
trons and holes. The holes remain in the valence band, but the free electrons go to 
the next-higher energy band, which is called the conduction band.  This is why 
Fig. 2-21 shows a conduction band with some free electrons and a valence band 
with some holes. When the switch is closed, a small current exists in the pure 
semiconductor. The free electrons move through the conduction band, and holes 
move through the valence band.
n-Type Energy Bands
Figure 2-22 shows the energy bands for an n-type semiconductor. As you would 
expect, the majority carriers are the free electrons in the conduction band, and the 
minority carriers are the holes in the valence band. Since the switch is closed in 
Fig. 2-22, the majority carriers fl  ow to the left, and the minority carriers fl  ow to 
the right.
p-Type Energy Bands
Figure 2-23 shows the energy bands for a p-type semiconductor. Here you see a 
reversal of the carrier roles. Now, the majority carriers are the holes in the valence 
band, and the minority carriers are the free electrons in the conduction band. Since 
the switch is closed in Fig. 2-23, the majority carriers fl  ow to the right, and the 
 minority carriers fl  ow to the left.25˚C

For both n- and p-type 
 semiconductors, an increase 
in temperature produces an 
 identical increase in the number 
of minority and majority current 
carriers.46 Chapter 22-13   Barrier Potential and 
Temperature
The junction temperature  is the temperature inside a diode, right at the pn junc-
tion. The ambient temperature  is different. It is the temperature of the air outside 
the diode, the air that surrounds the diode. When the diode is conducting, the 
junction temperature is higher than the ambient temperature because of the heat 
created by recombination.
 The barrier potential depends on the junction temperature. An increase in 
junction temperature creates more free electrons and holes in the doped regions. 
As these charges diffuse into the depletion layer, it becomes narrower. This means 
that there is less barrier potential at higher junction temperatures.
 Before continuing, we need to defi  ne a symbol:
D 5 the change in (2-2)
The Greek letter D (delta) stands for “the change in.” For instance, DV means the 
change in voltage, and DT means the change in temperature. The ratio DVyDT
stands for the change in voltage divided by the change in temperature.
 Now we can state a rule for estimating the change in barrier potential: The 
barrier potential of a silicon diode decreases by 2 mV for each degree Celsius rise.
 As a derivation:
DV ___ DT   5 22 mV y°C (2-3)
By rearranging:
DV 5 (22 mV y°C) DT (2-4)
With this, we can calculate the barrier potential at any junction temperature.
Example 2-5
Assuming a barrier potential of 0.7 V at an ambient temperature of 25°C, what is 
the barrier potential of a silicon diode when the junction temperature is 100°C? 
At 0°C?
SOLUTION   When the junction temperature is 100°C, the change in barrier 
 potential i s:
DV 5 (22 mV y°C) DT 5 (22 mV y°C)(100°C  2 25°C)  5 2150 mV
This tells us that the barrier potential decreases 150 mV from its room tempera-
ture value, so it equals:
VB 5 0.7 V  2 0.15 V  5 0.55 V
 When the junction temperature is 0°C, the change in barrier potential is:
DV 5 (22 mV y°C) DT 5 (22 mV y°C)(0°C  2 25°C)  5 50 mVSemiconductors 472-14  Reverse-Biased Diode
Let’s discuss a few advanced ideas about a reverse-biased diode. To begin with, 
the depletion layer changes in width when the reverse voltage changes. Let us see 
what this implies.
Transient Current
When the reverse voltage increases, holes and electrons move away from the junc-
tion. As the free electrons and holes move aw ay from the junction, they leave posi-
tive and negative ions behind. Therefore, the depletion layer gets wider. The  greater 
the reverse bias, the wider the depletion layer becomes. While the  depletion layer 
is adjusting to its new width, a current fl  ows in the external circuit. This transient 
current drops to zero after the depletion layer stops growing.
 The amount of time the transient current fl  ows depends on the RC time 
constant of the external circuit. It typically happens in a matter of nanoseconds. 
 Because of this, you can ignore the effects of the transient current below approxi-
mately 10 MHz.
Reverse Saturation Current
As discussed earlier, forward-biasing a diode decreases the width of the depletion 
layer and allows free  electrons to cross the junction. Reverse bias has the opposite 
effect: It widens the depletion layer by moving holes and free electrons away from 
the junction.
 Suppose that thermal energy creates a hole and free electron inside the 
depletion layer of a reverse-biased diode, as shown in Fig. 2-24. The free electron 
at A and the hole at B can now contribute to reverse current. Because of the reverse 
bias, the free electron will move to the right,  effectively pushing an electron out of 
the right end of the diode. Similarly, the hole will move to the left. This extra hole 
on the p side lets an electron enter the left end of the  crystal.
 This tells us that the barrier potential increases 50 mV from its room 
temperature value, so it equals:
VB 5 0.7 V  1 0.05 V  5 0.75 V

layer.48 Chapter 2 The higher the junction temperature, the greater the saturation current. 
A useful approximation to remember is this: IS doubles for each 10°C rise. As a 
 derivation,
Percent  DIS 5 100% for a 10°C increase (2-5)
In words, the change in saturation current is 100 percent for each 10°C rise in 
 temperature.  If the changes in temperature are less than 10°C, you can use this 
equivalent rule:
Percent DIS 5 7% per °C (2-6)
In words, the change in saturation current is 7 percent for each Celsius degree 
rise. This 7 percent solution is a close approximation of the 10° rule.
Silicon versus Germanium
In a silicon atom, the distance between the valence band and the conduction band 
is called the energy gap.  When thermal energy produces free electrons and holes, it 
has to give the valence electrons enough energy to jump into the conduction band. 
The larger the energy gap, the more diffi  cult it is for thermal energy to produce 
electron-hole pairs. Fortunately, silicon has a large energy gap; this means that 
thermal energy does not produce many electron-hole pairs at normal temperatures.
 In a germanium atom, the valence band is much closer to the conduc-
tion band. In other words, germanium has a much smaller energy gap than silicon 
has. For this reason, thermal energy produces many more electron-hole pairs in 
germanium devices. This is the fatal fl  aw mentioned earlier. The excessive reverse 
current of germanium devices precludes their widespread use in modern comput-
ers, consumer electronics, and communications circuits.
Surface-Leakage Current
We discussed surface-leakage current briefl  y in Sec. 2-10. Recall that it is a reverse 
current on the surface of the crystal. Here is an explanation of why surface-leakage 
current exists. Suppose that the atoms at the top and bottom of Fig. 2-25 a are on 
the surface of the crystal. Since these atoms have no neighbors, they have only six 
electrons in the valence orbit, implying two holes in each surface atom. Visualize 
these holes along the surface of the crystal shown in Fig. 2-25 b. Then you can see 
that the skin of a crystal is like a p-type semiconductor. Because of this, electrons 
can enter the left end of the crystal, travel through the surface holes, and leave the 
right end of the crystal. In this way, we get a small reverse current along the surface.
 The surface-leakage current is directly proportional to the reverse volt-
age. For instance, if you double the reverse voltage, the surface-leakage current 
ISL doubles. We can defi  ne the surface-leakage resistance as follows:
RSL 5   VR ___ ISL   (2-7)/H11001/H11001/H11001/H11001/H11001/H11001/H11001/H11001/H11001/H11001/H11001/H11001/H11001/H11001/H11001/H11001

Example 2-6
A silicon diode has a saturation current of 5 nA at 25°C. What is the saturation 
current at 100°C?
SOLUTION   The change in temperature is:
DT 5 100°C  2 25°C  5 75°CSemiconductors 49
With Eq. (2-5), there are seven doublings between 25°C and 95°C:
IS 5 (27)(5 nA)  5 640 nA
With Eq. (2-6), there are an additional 5° between 95°C and 100°C:
IS 5 (1.075)(640 nA)  5 898 nA
PRACTICE PROBLEM 2-6   Using the same diode as in Example 2-6, 
what would be the saturation current at 80°C?
Example 2-7
If the surface-leakage current is 2 nA for a reverse voltage of 25 V , what is the 
surface-leakage current for a reverse voltage of 35 V?
SOLUTION   There are two ways to solve this problem. First, calculate the 
surface-leakage resistance:
RSL 5   25 V _____ 2 nA   5 12.5(109) V
Then, calculate the surface-leakage current at 35 V as follows:
ISL 5   35 V __________  12.5(109) V   5 2.8 nA
 Here is a second method. Since surface-leakage current is directly 
 proportional to reverse voltage:
ISL 5   35 V _____  25 V   2 nA  5 2.8 nA
PRACTICE PROBLEM 2-7   In Example 2-7, what is the  surface-leakage 
current for a reverse voltage of 100 V?
SEC. 2-1  CONDUCTORS
A neutral copper atom has only one 
electron in its outer orbit. Since this 
single electron can be easily dis-
lodged from its atom, it is called a 
free electron.  Copper is a good con-
ductor because the slightest voltage 
causes free electrons to ﬂ  ow from 
one atom to the next.SEC. 2-2  SEMICONDUCTORS
Silicon is the most widely used 
semiconductor material. An isolated 
silicon atom has four electrons in its 
outer, or valence, orbit. The number 
of electrons in the valence orbit is 
the key to conductivity. Conductors 
have one valence electron, semicon-
ductors have four valence electrons, and insulators have eight valence 
electrons.
SEC. 2-3  SILICON CRYSTALS
Each silicon atom in a crystal has 
its four valence electrons plus four 
more electrons that are shared by 
the neighboring atoms. At room tem-
perature, a pure silicon crystal has Summary50 Chapter 2(2-2)   D 5 the change inDeﬁ nitions

 recombination of a free electron 
and a hole is called the lifetime.
SEC. 2-4   INTRINSIC 
SEMICONDUCTORS
An intrinsic semiconductor is a pure 
semiconductor. When an external 
voltage is applied to the intrinsic 
semiconductor, the free electrons 
ﬂ  ow toward the positive battery 
 terminal and the holes ﬂ  ow toward 
the negative battery terminal.
SEC. 2-5   TWO TYPES 
OF FLOW
Two types of carrier ﬂ  ow exist in an 
intrinsic semiconductor. First, there 
is the ﬂ  ow of free electrons through 
larger orbits (conduction band). 
Second, there is the ﬂ  ow of holes 
through smaller orbits (valence 
band).
SEC. 2-6   DOPING A 
SEMICONDUCTOR
Doping increases the conductiv-
ity of a semiconductor. A doped 
semiconductor is called an extrinsic 
semiconductor.  When an intrinsic 
semiconductor is doped with pen-
tavalent (donor) atoms, it has more 
free electrons than holes. When an 
intrinsic semiconductor is doped with 
trivalent (acceptor) atoms, it has more 
holes than free electrons.SEC. 2-7   TWO TYPES 
OF EXTRINSIC 
SEMICONDUCTORS
In an n-type semiconductor, the free 
electrons are the majority carriers, and 
the holes are the minority carriers. In 
a p-type semiconductor, the holes 
are the majority carriers, and the free 
electrons are the minority carriers.
SEC. 2-8   THE UNBIASED 
DIODE
An unbiased diode has a depletion 
layer at the pn junction. The ions in 
this depletion layer produce a barrier 
potential. At room temperature, this 
barrier potential is approximately 
0.7 V for a silicon diode and 0.3 V for 
a germanium diode.
SEC. 2-9  FORWARD BIAS
When an external voltage opposes the 
barrier potential, the diode is forward-
biased. If the applied voltage is greater 
than the barrier potential, the current 
is large. In other words, current ﬂ  ows 
easily in a forward-biased diode.
SEC. 2-10  REVERSE BIAS
When an external voltage aids 
the barrier potential, the diode is 
reverse-biased. The width of the 
depletion layer increases when the 
reverse voltage increases. The cur-
rent is approximately zero.
SEC. 2-11  BREAKDOWN
Too much reverse voltage will pro-
duce either avalanche or zener eff  ect. Then, the large breakdown current 
destroys the diode. In general, diodes 
are never operated in the breakdown 
region. The only exception is the 
zener diode, a special-purpose diode 
discussed in a later chapter.
SEC. 2-12  ENERGY LEVELS
The larger the orbit, the higher the 
energy level of an electron. If an 
outside force raises an electron to a 
higher energy level, the electron will 
emit energy when it falls back to its 
original orbit.
SEC. 2-13   BARRIER POTENTIAL 
AND TEMPERATURE
When the junction temperature 
increases, the depletion layer 
 becomes narrower and the barrier 
potential decreases. It will decrease 
approximately 2 mV for each degree 
Celsius increase.
SEC. 2-14   REVERSE-BIASED 
DIODE
There are three components of 
 reverse current in a diode. First, 
there is the transient current that 
occurs when the reverse  voltage 
changes. Second, there is the 
 minority-carrier current, also called 
the saturation current  because it is 
independent of the reverse voltage. 
Third, there is the surface-leakage 
current. It increases when the 
reverse voltage increases.Semiconductors 51Self-Test

 Diode Theory
This chapter continues our study of diodes. After discussing 
the diode curve, we look at approximations of a diode. We 
need approximations because exact analysis is tedious and 
time consuming in most situations. For instance, an ideal 
approximation is usually adequate for troubleshooting, and a 
second approximation gives quick and easy solutions in many 
cases. Beyond this, we can use a third approximation for better 
accuracy or a computer solution for almost exact answers.

An ordinary resistor is a linear device  because the graph of its current versus 
voltage is a straight line. A diode is different. It is a nonlinear device  because 
the graph of its current versus voltage is not a straight line. The reason is the bar-
rier potential. When the diode voltage is less than the barrier potential, the diode 
current is small. When the diode voltage exceeds the barrier potential, the 
diode current increases rapidly.
The Schematic Symbol and Case Styles
Figure 3-1 a shows the pn structure and schematic symbol of a diode. The p side 
is called the anode,  and the n side the cathode.  The diode symbol looks like an 
arrow that points from the p side to the n side, from the anode to the cathode. 
Figure 3-1 b shows some of the many typical diode case styles. Many, but not all, 
diodes have the cathode lead (K) identifi  ed by a colored band.
Basic Diode Circuit
Figure 3-1 c shows a diode circuit. In this circuit, the diode is forward biased. How 
do we know? Because the positive battery terminal drives the p side through a 
resistor, and the negative battery terminal is connected to the n side. With this con-
nection, the circuit is trying to push holes and free electrons toward the junction.
 In more complicated circuits, it may be diffi  cult to decide whether the 
diode is forward biased. Here is a guideline. Ask yourself this question: Is the 
 external circuit pushing current in the easy direction  of fl  ow? If the answer is yes, 
the diode is forward biased.
 What is the easy direction of fl  ow? If you use conventional current, the 
easy direction is the same direction as the diode arrow. If you prefer electron fl  ow, 
the easy direction is the other way.

(c)–+Diode Theory 59 When the diode is part of a complicated circuit, we also can use 
Thevenin’s theorem to determine whether it is forward biased. For instance, as-
sume that we have reduced a complicated circuit with Thevenin’s theorem to get 
Fig. 3-1 c. We would know that the diode is forward biased.
The Forward Region
Figure 3-1 c is a circuit that you can set up in the laboratory. After you connect this 
circuit, you can measure the diode current and voltage. You can also reverse the 
polarity of the dc source and measure diode current and voltage for reverse bias. 
If you plot the diode current versus the diode voltage, you will get a graph that 
looks like Fig. 3-2.
 This is a visual summary of the ideas discussed in the preceding chapter. 
For instance, when the diode is forward biased, there is no signifi  cant current until 
the diode voltage is greater than the barrier potential. On the other hand, when the 
diode is reverse biased, there is almost no reverse current until the diode voltage 
reaches the breakdown voltage. Then, avalanche produces a large reverse current, 
destroying the diode.
Knee Voltage
In the forward region, the voltage at which the current starts to increase rapidly is 
called the knee voltage  of the diode. The knee voltage equals the barrier potential. 
Analysis of diode circuits usually comes down to determining whether the diode 
voltage is more or less than the knee voltage. If it’s more, the diode conducts 
 easily. If it’s less, the diode conducts poorly. We defi  ne the knee voltage of a 
silicon diode as:
VK /H11015 0.7 V  (3-1)
(Note:  The symbol  < means “approximately equal to.”)
 Even though germanium diodes are rarely used in new designs, you may 
still encounter germanium diodes in special circuits or in older equipment. For 
this reason, remember that the knee voltage of a germanium diode is approxi-
mately 0.3 V . This lower knee voltage is an advantage and accounts for the use of 
a germanium diode in certain applications.
Bulk Resistance
Above the knee voltage, the diode current increases rapidly. This means that small 
increases in the diode voltage cause large increases in diode current. After the ID

GOOD TO KNOW
Special purpose diodes, such 
as the Schottky diode, have 
replaced the germanium diode 
in modern applications requiring 
low knee voltages.60 Chapter 3 barrier potential is overcome, all that impedes the current is the ohmic resistance
of the p and n regions. In other words, if the p and n regions were two separate 
pieces of semiconductor, each would have a resistance that you could measure 
with an ohmmeter, the same as an ordinary resistor.
 The sum of the ohmic resistances is called the bulk resistance  of the 
diode. It is defi  ned as:
RB 5 RP 1 RN (3-2)
The bulk resistance depends on the size of the p and n regions and how heavily 
doped they are. Often, the bulk resistance is less than 1 V.
Maximum DC Forward Current
If the current in a diode is too large, the excessive heat can destroy the diode. For 
this reason, a manufacturer’s data sheet specifi  es the maximum current a diode 
can safely handle without shortening its life or degrading its characteristics.
 The maximum forward current  is one of the maximum ratings given 
on a data sheet. This current may be listed as Imax, IF(max) , IO, etc., depending on 
the manufacturer. For instance, a 1N456 has a maximum forward current rating 
of 135 mA. This means that it can safely handle a continuous forward current of 
135 mA.
Power Dissipation
You can calculate the power dissipation of a diode the same way as you do for a 
resistor. It equals the product of diode voltage and current. As a formula:
PD 5 VDID (3-3)
 The power rating  is the maximum power the diode can safely dissipate 
without shortening its life or degrading its properties. In symbols, the defi  nition is:
Pmax 5 VmaxImax (3-4)
where Vmax is the voltage corresponding to Imax. For instance, if a diode has a 
 maximum voltage and current of 1 V and 2 A, its power rating is 2 W.
Example 3-1 
Is the diode of Fig. 3-3 a forward biased or reverse biased?
SOLUTION   The voltage across R2 is positive; therefore, the circuit is try-
ing to push current in the easy direction of fl  ow. If this is not clear, visualize the 
Thevenin circuit facing the diode as shown in Fig. 3-3 b. In order to determine the 
Thevenin equivalent, remember that VTH 5   R2— R1 1 R2   (VS) and RTH 5   R1 — R2  . In this series 
circuit, you can see that the dc source is trying to push current in the easy direction 
of fl  ow. Therefore, the diode is forward biased.
 Whenever in doubt, reduce the circuit to a series circuit. Then, it will 
be  clear whether the dc source is trying to push current in the easy direction 
or not.Diode Theory 61
PRACTICE PROBLEM 3-1   Are the diodes of Fig. 3-3 c forward biased or 
reverse biased?
Example 3-2
A diode has a power rating of 5 W. If the diode voltage is 1.2 V and the diode 
current is 1.75 A, what is the power dissipation? Will the diode be  destroyed?
SOLUTION
PD 5 (1.2 V)(1.75 A)  5 2.1 W
This is less than the power rating, so the diode will not be destroyed.

3-2 The Ideal Diode
Figure 3-4 shows a detailed graph of the forward region of a diode. Here you see 
the diode current ID versus diode voltage VD. Notice how the current is approxi-
mately zero until the diode voltage approaches the barrier potential. Somewhere 
in the vicinity of 0.6 to 0.7 V , the diode current increases. When the diode voltage 
is greater than 0.8 V , the diode current is signifi  cant and the graph is almost linear.
 Depending on how a diode is doped and its physical size, it may dif-
fer from other diodes in its maximum forward current, power rating, and other 
 characteristics. If we need an exact solution, we have to use the graph of the 62 Chapter 3particular diode. Although the exact current and voltage points will differ from 
one diode to the next, the graph of any diode is similar to Fig. 3-4. All silicon 
diodes have a knee voltage of approximately 0.7 V .
 Most of the time, we do not need an exact solution. This is why we 
can and should use approximations for a diode. We will begin with the simplest 
 approximation, called an ideal diode.  In the most basic terms, what does a diode 
do? It conducts well in the forward direction and poorly in the reverse direc-
tion.  Ideally, a diode acts like a perfect conductor (zero resistance) when forward 
 biased and like a perfect insulator (infi  nite resistance) when reverse biased.
 Figure 3-5 a shows the current-voltage graph of an ideal diode. It echoes 
what we just said: zero resistance when forward biased and infi  nite resistance 
when reverse biased. It is impossible to build such a device, but this is what man-
ufacturers would produce if they could.
 Is there any device that acts like an ideal diode? Yes. An ordinary switch 
has zero resistance when closed and infi  nite resistance when open. Therefore, an 
ideal diode acts like a switch that closes when forward biased and opens when 
 reverse biased. Figure 3-5 b summarizes the switch idea.40 mA

Example 3-3
Use the ideal diode to calculate the load voltage and load current in Fig. 3-6 a.
SOLUTION   Since the diode is forward biased, it is equivalent to a closed 
switch. Visualize the diode as a closed switch. Then, you can see that all of the 
source voltage appears across the load resistor:
VL 5 10 V
With Ohm’s law, the load current is:

source voltage is 5 V .
Example 3-4
Calculate the load voltage and load current in Fig. 3-6 b using an ideal diode.
SOLUTION   One way to solve this problem is to Thevenize the circuit 
to the left of the diode. Looking from the diode back toward the source, we 
see a  voltage divider with 6 k V and 3 k V. The Thevenin voltage is 12 V , and 
the Thevenin resistance is 2 k V. Figure 3-6 c shows the Thevenin circuit driving

–+Figure 3-664 Chapter 33-3 The Second Approximation
The ideal approximation is all right in most troubleshooting situations. But we are 
not always troubleshooting. Sometimes, we want a more accurate value for load 
current and load voltage. This is where the second approximation  comes in.
 Figure 3-7 a shows the graph of current versus voltage for the second 
 approximation. The graph says that no current exists until 0.7 V appears across the 
diode. At this point, the diode turns on. Thereafter, only 0.7 V can appear across 
the diode, no matter what the current.
 Figure 3-7 b shows the equivalent circuit for the second approximation of 
a silicon diode. We think of the diode as a switch in series with a barrier potential of 
0.7 V . If the Thevenin voltage facing the diode is greater than 0.7 V , the switch will 
close. When conducting, then the diode voltage is 0.7 V for any forward  current.
 On the other hand, if the Thevenin voltage is less than 0.7 V , the switch 
will open. In this case, there is no current through the diode.
 Now that we have a series circuit, we can see that the diode is forward 
biased. Visualize the diode as a closed switch. Then, the remaining calculations 
are:
IL 5   12 V _____ 3 kV   5 4 mA
and
VL 5 (4 mA)(1 k V) 5 4 V
 You don’t have to use Thevenin’s theorem. You can analyze Fig. 3-6 b 
by visualizing the diode as a closed switch. Then, you have 3 k V in parallel with 
1 kV, equivalent to 750 V. Using Ohm’s law, you can calculate a voltage drop of 
32 V across the 6 k V. The rest of the analysis produces the same load voltage and 
load current.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 3-4   Using Fig. 3-6 b, change the 36 V source to 
18 V and solve for the load voltage and load current using an ideal diode.

When you troubleshoot a circuit 
that contains a silicon diode 
that is supposed to be forward 
biased, a diode voltage mea-
surement much greater than 
0.7 V means that the diode has 
failed and is, in fact, open.Diode Theory 65
Example 3-5
Use the second approximation to calculate the load voltage, load current, and 
diode power in Fig. 3-8.

0.7 V . This means that the load voltage equals the source voltage minus the diode

As before, the Thevenin voltage is 12 V and the Thevenin resistance is 2 k V. Fig-
ure 3-9 b shows the simplifi  ed circuit.

PRACTICE PROBLEM 3-6   Repeat Example 3-6 using 18 V as the volt-
age source value.Example 3-6
Calculate the load voltage, load current, and diode power in Fig. 3-9 a using the 
second approximation.66 Chapter 33-4 The Third Approximation
In the third approximation  of a diode, we include the bulk resistance RB. Fig-
ure 3-10 a shows the effect that RB has on the diode curve. After the silicon diode 
turns on, the voltage increases linearly with an increase in current. The greater the 
 current, the larger the diode voltage because of the voltage drop across the bulk 
resistance.
 The equivalent circuit for the third approximation is a switch in series 
with a barrier potential of 0.7 V and a resistance of RB (see Fig. 3-10 b). When the 
diode voltage is larger than 0.7 V , the diode conducts. During conduction, the total 
voltage across the diode is:
VD 5 0.7 V  1 IDRB (3-5)
Often, the bulk resistance is less than 1 V, and we can safely ignore it in our 
 calculations. A useful guideline for ignoring bulk resistance is this defi  nition:
Ignore bulk: RB /H11021 0.01RTH (3-6)
This says to ignore the bulk resistance when it is less than 1/100 of the Thevenin 
 resistance facing the diode. When this condition is satisfi  ed, the error is less than 
1 percent. The third approximation is rarely used by technicians because circuit 
designers usually satisfy Eq. (3-6).ID

The 1N4001 of Fig. 3-11 a has a bulk resistance of 0.23 V. What is the load voltage, load current, and diode power?
SOLUTION  Replacing the diode with its third approximation, we get Fig. 3-11 b. The bulk resistance is small enough 
to ignore because it is less than 1/100 of the load resistance. In this case, we can use the second approximation to solve 
the problem. We already did this in Example 3-6, where we found a load voltage, load current, and diode power of 9.3 V , 
9.3 mA, and 6.51 mW.Diode Theory 67

 To calculate the diode power, we need to know the diode voltage. We can get this in either of two ways. We can 
subtract the load voltage from the source voltage:
VD 5 10 V  2 9.09 V  5 0.91 V
or we can use Eq. (3-5):
VD 5 0.7 V  1 (0.909 A)(0.23 V) 5 0.909 V
The slight difference in the last two answers is caused by rounding. The diode power is:
PD 5 (0.909 V)(0.909 A)  5 0.826 W
 Two more points. First, the 1N4001 has a maximum forward current of 1 A and a power rating of 1 W, so the diode 
is being pushed to its limits with a load resistance of 10 V. Second, the load voltage calculated with the third approximation 
is 9.09 V , which is in agreement with the Multisim load voltage (see Fig. 3-12 b).

First or ideal Second or practical ThirdDiode Theory 693-5 Troubleshooting
You can quickly check the condition of a diode with an ohmmeter on a medium-
to-high  resistance range. Measure the dc resistance of the diode in either direction, 
and then reverse the leads and measure the dc resistance again. The forward 
 current will depend on which ohmmeter range is used, which means that you get 
 different readings on different ranges.
 The main thing to look for, however, is a high ratio of reverse to forward 
resistance. For typical silicon diodes used in electronics work, the ratio should 
be higher than 1000:1. Remember to use a high enough resistance range to avoid 
the possibility of diode damage. Normally, the R 3 100 or R 3 1K ranges will 
 provide proper safe measurements.
 Using an ohmmeter to check diodes is an example of go/no-go testing. 
You’re really not interested in the exact dc resistance of the diode; all you want 
to know is whether the diode has a low resistance in the forward direction and a 
high resistance in the reverse direction. Diode troubles are indicated for any of 
the following: extremely low resistance in both directions (diode shorted); high 
resistance in both directions (diode open); somewhat low resistance in the reverse 
 direction (called a leaky diode ).
 When set to the ohms or resistance function, most digital multimeters 
(DMMs) do not have the required voltage and current output capability to prop-
erly test pn-junction diodes. Most DMMs do, however, have a special diode 
test range. When the meter is set to this range, it supplies a constant current of 
 approximately 1 mA to whatever device is connected to its leads. When forward 
 biased, the DMM will display the pn junction’s forward voltage VF shown in 
Fig. 3-13 a. This forward voltage will generally be between 0.5 V and 0.7 V for 
normal silicon pn-junction diodes. When the diode is reverse biased by the test 
leads, the meter will give an overrange indication such as “OL” or “1” on the 
display as shown in Fig. 3-13 b. A shorted diode would display a voltage of less 
than 0.5 V in both directions. An open diode would be indicated by an overrange 
display in both directions. A leaky diode would display a voltage less than 2.0 V 
in both directions.

Example 3-9
Figure 3-14 shows the diode circuit analyzed earlier. Suppose something causes 
the diode to burn out. What kind of symptoms will you get?
SOLUTION   When a diode burns out, it becomes an open circuit. In this case, 
the current drops to zero. Therefore, if you measure the load voltage, the voltmeter 
will indicate zero.
Example 3-10
Suppose the circuit in Fig. 3-14 is not working. If the load is not shorted, what is 
the trouble?
SOLUTION   Many troubles are possible. First, the diode could be open. Sec-
ond, the supply voltage could be zero. Third, one of the connecting wires could 
be open.
 How do you fi  nd the trouble? Measure the voltages to isolate the defec-
tive component. Then disconnect any suspected component and test its resistance. 
For instance, you could measure the source voltage fi  rst and the load  voltage sec-
ond. If there is source voltage but no load voltage, the diode may be open. An 
ohmmeter or DMM test will tell. If the diode passes the ohmmeter or DMM test, 
check the connections because there’s nothing else to account for having source 
voltage but no load voltage.
 If there is no source voltage, the power supply is defective or a connec-
tion between the supply and the diode is open. Power-supply troubles are common. 
Often, when electronics equipment is not working, the trouble is in the power sup-
ply. This is why most troubleshooters start by measuring the voltages out of the 
power supply.VS

A data sheet, or specifi  cation sheet, lists important parameters and operating char-
acteristics for semiconductor devices. Also, essential information such as case 
styles, pinouts, testing procedures, and typical applications can be obtained from 
a component’s data sheet. Semiconductor manufacturers generally provide this 
information in data books or on the manufacturer’s website. This information can 
also be found on the Internet by companies that specialize in cross-referencing or 
component substitution.
 Much of the information on a manufacturer’s data sheet is obscure and 
of use only to circuit designers. For this reason, we will discuss only those entries 
on the data sheet that describe quantities in this book.
Reverse Breakdown Voltage
Let us start with the data sheet for a 1N4001, a rectifi  er diode used in power sup-
plies (circuits that convert ac voltage to dc voltage). Figure 3-15 shows a data sheet 
for the 1N4001 to 1N4007 series of diodes: seven diodes that have the same for-
ward characteristics but differ in their reverse characteristics. We are interested in 
the 1N4001 member of this family. The fi  rst entry under “Absolute Maximum Rat-
ings” is this:
Symbol 1N4001
Peak Repetitive Reverse Voltage VRRM 50 V
The breakdown voltage for this diode is 50 V . This breakdown occurs because the 
diode goes into avalanche when a huge number of carriers suddenly appears in 
the depletion layer. With a rectifi  er diode like the 1N4001, breakdown is usually 
 destructive.
 With the 1N4001, a reverse voltage of 50 V represents a destructive level 
that a designer avoids under all operating conditions. This is why a designer in-
cludes a safety factor.  There is no absolute rule on how large to make the safety 
factor because it depends on too many design factors. A conservative design 
would use a safety factor of 2, which means never allowing a reverse voltage of 
more than 25 V across the 1N4001. A less conservative design might allow as 
much as 40 V across the 1N4001.
 On other data sheets, reverse breakdown voltage may be designated PIV, 
PRV, or BV.
Maximum Forward Current
Another entry of interest is average rectifi  ed forward current, which looks like this 
on the data sheet:
Symbol Value
Average Rectiﬁ  ed Forward Current
  @ TA 5 75°CIF(AV) 1 A
This entry tells us that the 1N4001 can handle up to 1 A in the forward direction 
when used as a rectifi  er. You will learn more about average rectifi  ed forward cur-
rent in the next chapter. For now, all you need to know is that 1 A is the level of GOOD TO KNOW

Google, can quickly help locate

forward current when the diode burns out because of excessive power dissipation. 
On other data sheets, the average current may be designated as Io.
 Again, a designer looks upon 1 A as the absolute maximum rating of the 
1N4001, a level of forward current that should not even be approached. This is 
why a safety factor would be included—possibly a factor of 2. In other words, a 
reliable design would ensure that the forward current is less than 0.5 A under all 
operating conditions. Failure studies of devices show that the lifetime of a device 
decreases the closer you get to the maximum rating. This is why some designers 
use a safety factor of as much as 10:1. A really conservative design would keep the 
maximum forward current of the 1N4001 at 0.1 A or less.74 Chapter 3Forward Voltage Drop
Under “Electrical Characteristics” in Fig. 3-15, the fi  rst entry shown gives you the 
following data:
Characteristic and Conditions SymbolMaximum
Value
Forward Voltage Drop
  (iF) 5 1.0 A, TA 5 25°C VF 1.1 V
As shown in Fig. 3-15 on the chart titled “Forward Characteristics,” the typical 
1N4001 has a forward voltage drop of 0.93 V when the current is 1 A and the 
junction temperature is 25°C. If you test thousands of 1N4001s, you will fi  nd that 
a few will have as much as 1.1 V across them when the current is 1 A.
Maximum Reverse Current
Another entry on the data sheet that is worth discussing is this one:
Characteristic and Conditions SymbolMaximum
Value
Reverse Current IR
TA 5 25°C 10 /H9262A
TA 5 100°C 50 /H9262A
This is the reverse current at the maximum reverse dc rated voltage (50 V for a 
1N4001). At 25°C, the 1N4001 has a maximum reverse current of 10 /H9262A. But 
notice how it increases to 50 /H9262A at 100°C. Remember that this reverse current 
includes thermally produced saturation current and surface-leakage current. You 
can see from these numbers that temperature is important. A design that  requires a 
reverse current of less than 10 /H9262A will work fi  ne at 25°C with a 1N4001, but will 
fail in mass production if the junction temperature reaches 100°C.
3-7  How to Calculate Bulk 
Resistance
When you are trying to analyze a diode circuit accurately, you will need to know 
the bulk resistance of the diode. Manufacturers’ data sheets do not usually list the 
bulk resistance separately, but they do give enough information to allow you to 
calculate it. Here is the derivation for bulk resistance:
RB 5   V2 2 V1 _______ I2 2 I1   (3-7)
where V1 and I1 are the voltage and current at some point at or above the knee volt-
age; V2 and I2 are the voltage and current at some higher point on the diode curve.
 For instance, the data sheet of a 1N4001 gives a forward voltage of 
0.93 V for a current of 1 A. Since this is a silicon diode, it has a knee voltage of 
approximately 0.7 V and a current of approximately zero. Therefore, the values to 
use are V2 5 0.93 V , I2 5 1 A, V1 5 0.7 V , and I1 5 0. Substituting these values 
into an equation, we get a bulk resistance of:
RB 5   V2 2 V1 _______ I2 2 I1   5   0.93 V  2 0.7 V  _____________   1 A 2 0 A   5   0.23 V ______ 1 A   5 0.23 VDiode Theory 75 Incidentally, the diode curve is a graph of current versus voltage. The 
bulk resistance equals the inverse of the slope above the knee. The greater the 
slope of the diode curve, the smaller the bulk resistance. In other words, the more 
vertical the diode curve is above the knee, the lower the bulk resistance.
3-8 DC Resistance of a Diode
If you take the ratio of total diode voltage to total diode current, you get the dc 
 resistance  of the diode. In the forward direction, this dc resistance is symbolized 
by RF; in the reverse direction, it is designated RR.
Forward Resistance
Because the diode is a nonlinear device, its dc resistance varies with the current 
through it. For example, here are some pairs of forward current and voltage for a 
1N914: 10 mA at 0.65 V , 30 mA at 0.75 V , and 50 mA at 0.85 V . At the fi  rst point, 
the dc resistance is:
RF 5   0.65 V ______ 10 mA   5 65 V
At the second point:
RF 5   0.75 V ______ 30 mA   5 25 V
And at the third point:
RF 5   0.85 mV ________  50 mA   5 17 V
Notice how the dc resistance decreases as the current increases. In any case, the 
forward resistance is low compared to the reverse resistance.
Reverse Resistance
Similarly, here are two sets of reverse current and voltage for a 1N914: 25 nA at 
20 V; 5 /H9262A at 75 V . At the fi  rst point, the dc resistance is:
RR 5   20 V ______ 25 nA   5 800 M V
At the second point:
RR 5   75 V ______  5 /H9262A   5 15 M V
Notice how the dc resistance decreases as we approach the breakdown voltage 
(75 V).
DC Resistance versus Bulk Resistance
The dc resistance of a diode is different from the bulk resistance. The dc resis-
tance of a diode equals the bulk resistance plus the effect of the barrier potential. 
In other words, the dc resistance of a diode is its total resistance, whereas the bulk 
 resistance is the resistance of only the p and n regions. For this reason, the dc 
 resistance of a diode is always greater than the bulk resistance.76 Chapter 33-9 Load Lines
This section is about the load line,  a tool used to fi  nd the exact value of diode cur-
rent and voltage. Load lines are useful with transistors, so a detailed explanation 
will be given later in the transistor discussions.
Equation for the Load Line
How can we fi  nd the exact diode current and voltage in Fig. 3-16 a? The current 
through the resistor is:
ID 5   VS 2 VD ________  Rs   (3-8)
Because of the series circuit, this current is the same through the diode.
An Example
If the source voltage is 2 V and the resistance is 100 V as shown in Fig. 3-16 b, 
then Eq. (3-8) becomes:
ID 5   2 2 VD _______  100   (3-9)
 Equation (3-9) is a linear relationship between current and voltage. If we 
plot this equation, we will get a straight line. For instance, let VD equal zero. Then:
ID 5   2 V 2 0 V _________  100 V   5 20 mA
Plotting this point ( ID 5 20 mA, VD 5 0) gives the point on the vertical axis of 
Fig. 3-17. This point is called saturation  because it represents maximum current 
with 2 V across 100 V.VD(a)

Q(OPERATING POINT)
CUTOFFFigure 3-17  Q point is the intersection of the diode curve and the load line.Diode Theory 77 Here’s how to get another point. Let VD equal 2 V . Then Eq. (3-9) gives:
ID 5   2 V 2 2 V _________  100 V   5 0
When we plot this point ( ID 5 0, VD 5 2 V), we get the point shown on the hori-
zontal axis (Fig. 3-17). This point is called cutoff  because it represents minimum 
current.
 By selecting other voltages, we can calculate and plot additional points. 
Because Eq. (3-9) is linear, all points will lie on the straight line shown in 
Fig. 3-17. The straight line is called the load line.
The Q Point
Figure 3-17 shows the load line and a diode curve. The point of intersection, 
known as the Q point, represents a simultaneous solution between the diode curve 
and the load line. In other words, the Q point is the only point on the graph that 
works for both the diode and the circuit. By reading the coordinates of the Q point, 
we get a current of 12.5 mA and a diode voltage of 0.75 V .
 Incidentally, the Q point has no relationship to the fi  gure of merit of a 
coil. In the present discussion, Q is an abbreviation for quiescent,  which means 
“at rest.” The quiescent or Q point of semiconductor circuits is discussed in later 
chapters.
3-10  Surface-Mount Diodes
Surface-mount (SM) diodes can be found anywhere there is a need for diode 
 applications. SM diodes are small, effi  cient, and relatively easy to test, remove, 
and replace on the circuit board. Although there are a number of SM package 
styles, two basic styles dominate the industry: SM (surface mount) and SOT 
(small outline transistor).
 The SM package has two L-bend leads and a colored band on one end of 
the body to indicate the cathode lead. Figure 3-18 shows a typical set of dimen-
sions. The length and width of the SM package are related to the current rating 
of the device. The larger the surface area, the higher the current rating. So an SM 
diode rated at 1 A might have a surface area given by 0.181 by 0.115 in. The 3 A 
version, on the other hand, might measure 0.260 by 0.236 in. The thickness tends 
to remain at about 0.103 in for all current ratings.

CATHODE COLOR BAND0.1 in
SCALE78 Chapter 3 Increasing the surface area of an SM-style diode increases its ability to 
dissipate heat. Also, the corresponding increase in the width of the mounting ter-
minals increases the thermal conductance to a virtual heat sink made up of the 
solder joints, mounting lands, and the circuit board itself.
 SOT-23 packages have three gull-wing terminals (see Fig. 3-19). The 
terminals are numbered counterclockwise from the top, pin 3 being alone on 
one side. However, there are no standard markings indicating which two termi-
nals are used for the cathode and the anode. To determine the internal connections 
of the diode, you can look for clues printed on the circuit board, check the sche-
matic diagram, or consult the diode manufacturer’s data book. Some SOT-style 
packages include two diodes, which have a common-anode or common-cathode 
connection at one of the terminals.
 Diodes in SOT-23 packages are small, no dimension being greater than 
0.1 in. Their small size makes it diffi  cult to dissipate larger amounts of heat, so the 
diodes are generally rated at less than 1 A. The small size also makes it impracti-
cal to label them with identifi  cation codes. As with many of the tiny SM devices, 
you have to determine the pin confi  guration from other clues on the circuit board 
and schematic diagram.
3-11  Introduction to Electronic 
Systems
In your study of Electronic Principles,  you will be introduced to a variety of elec-
tronic semiconductor devices. Each of these devices will have unique properties 
and characteristics. Your knowledge of how these individual components function 
is very important. But this is just the beginning.
 These electronic devices normally do not function on their own. Instead, 
with the addition of other electronic components, such as resistors, capacitors, 
inductors, and other semiconductor devices, they are interconnected to form elec-
tronic circuits. These electronic circuits are often categorized into subsets, such 
as analog circuits and digital circuits, or application specifi  c circuits as amplifi  -
ers, converters, rectifi  ers, and so on. While analog circuits operate with infi  nitely 
varying quantities, often referred to as linear electronics, digital circuits gener-
ally operate with signal levels found in two distinct states representing logical or 
numeric values. A basic diode rectifi  er circuit, using a transformer, diode, capaci-
tor, and resistor, is shown in Fig. 3-20 a.
 What happens when different types of circuits are connected together?  
By combining a variety of circuits, functional blocks can be formed. These blocks, 
which can be made up of multiple stages, are designed to take a specifi  c type of Figure 3-19  The SOT-23 is a three-terminal transistor package commonly used 
for SM diodes.

plifi er, with two stages, used to increase signal levels from an input of 10 mVp-p 
to an output of 10 Vp-p.
 Can electronic functional blocks be interconnected? Absolutely! This is 
when the study of electronics becomes so dynamic and diverse. These intercon-
nected electronic function blocks are essentially grouped together to create elec-
tronic systems.  Electronic systems can be found in a variety of areas including 
automation and industrial control, communications, computer information, secu-
rity systems and more. Fig. 3-20 c is a block diagram of a basic communications 
receiver system broken down into functional blocks. This type of diagram is very 
useful when troubleshooting systems.
 In summary, semiconductor components are combined with other com-
ponents to form circuits. Circuits can be combined to become functional blocks.  
Functional blocks can be interconnected to form electronic systems. To go one 
step further, electronic systems are often connected to form complex systems.
 To help understand how these concepts all work together, this chapter in-
troduces a Digital/Analog Trainer System. This trainer is used for building, testing, 
and prototyping analog and digital circuits. Many of the electronic devices found 
in following chapters are used in this trainer. Some chapters in this textbook will 
have end-of-chapter questions referring to this trainer system. This will give you 
experience seeing how individual electronic components work together and how 
circuits function together.

Summary
SEC. 3-1  BASIC IDEAS
A diode is a nonlinear device. The 
knee voltage, approximately 0.7 V 
for a silicon diode, is where the for-
ward curve turns upward. The bulk 
resistance is the ohmic resistance 
of the p and n regions. Diodes have 
a maximum forward current and a 
power rating.
SEC. 3-2  THE IDEAL DIODE
This is the ﬁ  rst approximation of a 
diode. The equivalent circuit is a 
switch that closes when forward 
biased and opens when reverse 
biased.
SEC. 3-3   THE SECOND 
APPROXIMATION
In this approximation, we visualize 
a silicon diode as a switch in series 
with a knee voltage of 0.7 V. If the 
Thevenin voltage facing the diode is 
greater than 0.7 V, the switch closes.
SEC. 3-4   THE THIRD 
APPROXIMATION
We seldom use this approximation 
because bulk resistance is usually 
small enough to ignore. In this ap-
proximation, we visualize the diode 
as a switch in series with a knee volt-
age and a bulk resistance.
SEC. 3-5  TROUBLESHOOTING
When you suspect that a diode is 
the trouble, remove it from the circuit 
and use an ohmmeter to measure 
its resistance in each direction. You should get a high resistance one 
way and a low resistance the other 
way, at least 1000:1 ratio. Remember 
to use a high enough resistance 
range when testing a diode to avoid 
possible diode damage. A DMM will 
display 0.5–0.7 V when a diode is 
forward biased and an overrange 
 indication when it is reverse biased.
SEC. 3-6   READING A DATA 
SHEET
Data sheets are useful to a circuit 
 designer and may be useful to a 
 repair technician when  selecting 
a substitute device, which is 
 sometimes required. Diode data 
sheets from  diff erent  manufacturers 
 contain  similar information, but 
 diff erent  symbols are used to indi-
cate  diff erent operating conditions. 
Diode data sheets may list the 
following: breakdown voltage 
(VR, VRRM, VRWM, PIV, PRV, BV), 
 maximum forward  current 
(IF(max), IF(av), I0),  forward  voltage drop 
(VF(max ), VF), and  maximum  reverse 
current ( IR(max ), IRRM).
SEC. 3-7   HOW TO CALCULATE 
BULK RESISTANCE
You need two points in the forward 
region of the third approximation. 
One point can be 0.7 V with zero 
current. The second point comes 
from the data sheet at a large forward 
current where both a voltage and a 
current are given.SEC. 3-8   DC RESISTANCE OF 
A DIODE
The dc resistance equals the diode 
voltage divided by the diode cur-
rent at some operating point. This 
resistance is what an ohmmeter will 
measure. DC resistance has limited 
application, aside from telling you that 
it is small in the forward direction and 
large in the reverse direction.
SEC. 3-9  LOAD LINES
The current and voltage in a diode 
circuit have to satisfy both the diode 
curve and Ohm’s law for the load 
resistor. These are two separate re-
quirements that graphically translate 
to the intersection of the diode curve 
and the load line.
SEC. 3-10   SURFACE-MOUNT 
DIODES
Surface-mount diodes are often 
found on modern electronics circuits 
boards. These diodes are small, effi   -
cient, and typically found either as an 
SM (surface-mount) or an SOT (small 
outline transistor) case style.

 Diode Circuits
Most electronic systems, like HDTVs, audio power ampliﬁ  ers, 
and computers, need a dc voltage to work properly. Since the 
power-line voltage is alternating and normally too high of a 
value, we need to reduce the ac line voltage and then convert 
it to a relatively constant dc output voltage. The section of the 
electronic system that produces this dc voltage is called the 
power supply. Within the power supply are circuits that allow 
current to ﬂ  ow in only one direction. These circuits are called 
rectiﬁ  ers. Other circuits will ﬁ  lter and regulate the dc output. 
This chapter discusses rectiﬁ  er circuits, ﬁ  lters, an introduction to 
voltage regulators, clippers, clampers, and voltage multipliers.

Figure 4-1 a shows a half-wave rectifi  er circuit. The ac source produces a sinu-
soidal voltage. Assuming an ideal diode, the positive half-cycle of source voltage 
will forward-bias the diode. Since the switch is closed, as shown in Fig. 4-1 b, the 
positive half-cycle of source voltage will appear across the load resistor. On the 
negative half-cycle, the diode is reverse biased. In this case, the ideal diode will 
appear as an open switch, as shown in Fig. 4-1 c, and no voltage appears across 
the load resistor.
Ideal Waveforms
Figure 4-2 a shows a graphical representation of the input voltage waveform. It 
is a sine wave with an instantaneous value of vin and a peak value of Vp(in). A 
pure  sinusoid like this has an average value of zero over one cycle because each 
instantaneous voltage has an equal and opposite voltage half a cycle later. If you 
measure this voltage with a dc voltmeter, you will get a reading of zero because a 
dc voltmeter indicates the average value.
In the half-wave rectifi  er of Fig. 4-2 b, the diode is conducting during the 
positive half-cycles but is nonconducting during the negative half-cycles. Because 
of this, the circuit clips off the negative half-cycles, as shown in Fig. 4-2 c. We 
call a waveform like this a half-wave signal.  This half-wave voltage produces a 
 unidirectional load current.  This means that it fl  ows in only one direction. If 
the diode were reversed, it would become forward biased when the input voltage 
was negative. As a result, the output pulses would be negative. This is shown in 
Fig. 4-2 d. Notice how the negative peaks are offset from the positive peaks and 
follow the negative alternations of the input voltage.
A half-wave signal like the one in Fig. 4-2 c is a pulsating dc voltage 
that increases to a maximum, decreases to zero, and then remains at zero during 
the negative half-cycle. This is not the kind of dc voltage we need for electron-
ics equipment. What we need is a constant voltage, the same as you get from a (a)

cussed later in this chapter).
When you are troubleshooting, you can use the ideal diode to analyze a 
half-wave rectifi  er. It’s useful to remember that the peak output voltage equals the 
peak input voltage:
Ideal half wave: Vp(out) 5 Vp(in) (4-1)
DC Value of Half-Wave Signal
The dc value of a signal  is the same as the average value. If you measure a signal 
with a dc voltmeter, the reading will equal the average value. In basic courses, the 
dc value of a half-wave signal is derived. The formula is:
Half wave: Vdc 5   Vp ___ /H9266   (4-2)
The proof of this derivation requires calculus because we have to work out the 
 average value over one cycle.
Since 1/ /H9266 < 0.318, you may see Eq. (4-2) written as:
Vdc < 0.318 Vp
When the equation is written in this form, you can see that the dc or average value 
equals 31.8 percent of the peak value. For instance, if the peak voltage of the half-
wave signal is 100 V , the dc voltage or average value is 31.8 V .
Output Frequency
The output frequency is the same as the input frequency. This makes sense when 
you compare Fig. 4-2 c with Fig. 4-2 a. Each cycle of input voltage produces one 
cycle of output voltage. Therefore, we can write:
Half wave: fout 5 fin (4-3)
We will use this derivation later with fi  lters.
Second Approximation
We don’t get a perfect half-wave voltage across the load resistor. Because of the 
barrier potential, the diode does not turn on until the ac source voltage reaches 
approximately 0.7 V . When the peak source voltage is much greater than 0.7 V , 
the load voltage will resemble a half-wave signal. For instance, if the peak source 
voltage is 100 V , the load voltage will be close to a perfect half-wave voltage. If 
the peak source voltage is only 5 V , the load voltage will have a peak of only 4.3 V . 
When you need to get a better answer, use this derivation:
2d half wave: Vp(out) 5 Vp(in) 2 0.7 V (4-4)
Higher Approximations
Most designers will make sure that the bulk resistance is much smaller than the 
Thevenin resistance facing the diode. Because of this, we can ignore bulk resist-
ance in almost every case. If you must have better accuracy than you can get with 
the second approximation, you should use a computer and a circuit simulator like 
Multisim.GOOD TO KNOW

Application Example 4-1
Figure 4-3 shows a half-wave rectifi  er that you can build on the lab bench or on a computer screen with Multisim. An 
 oscilloscope is across the 1 k V. Set the oscilloscope’s vertical input coupling switch or setting to dc. This will show us 
the half-wave load voltage. Also, a multimeter is across the 1 k V to read the dc load voltage. Calculate the theoretical 
values of peak load voltage and the dc load voltage. Then, compare these values to the readings on the  oscilloscope and 
the multimeter.
SOLUTION Figure 4-3 shows an ac source of 10 V and 60 Hz. Schematic  diagrams usually show ac source voltages 
as effective or rms values. Recall that the effective value  is the value of a dc voltage that produces the same heating  effect 
as the ac voltage.

Diode Circuits 914-2 The Transformer
Power companies in the United States supply a nominal line voltage of 120 V rms 
and a frequency of 60 Hz. The actual voltage coming out of a power outlet may 
vary from 105 to 125 V rms, depending on the time of day, the locality, and other 
factors. Line voltage is too high for most of the circuits used in electronics equip-
ment. This is why a transformer is commonly used in the power-supply section of 
almost all electronics equipment. The transformer steps the line voltage down to 
safer and lower levels that are more suitable for use with diodes, transistors, and 
other semiconductor devices.
Basic Idea
Earlier courses discussed the transformer in detail. All we need in this chapter is 
a brief review. Figure 4-4 shows a transformer. Here, you see line voltage applied 
to the primary winding of a transformer. Usually, the power plug has a third prong 
to ground the equipment. Because of the turns ratio N1/N2, the secondary voltage 
is stepped down when N1 is greater than N2.
Phasing Dots
Recall the meaning of the phasing dots shown at the upper ends of the windings. 
Dotted ends have the same instantaneous phase. In other words, when a positive 
half-cycle appears across the primary, a positive half-cycle appears across the 
Since the source voltage is 10 V rms, the fi  rst thing to do is calculate the peak value of the ac source. You know from 
earlier courses that the rms value of a sine wave equals:
Vrms 5 0.707 Vp
Therefore, the peak source voltage in Fig. 4-3 is:
Vp 5   Vrms _____ 0.707   5   10 V _____ 0.707   5 14.1 V
With an ideal diode, the peak load voltage is:
Vp(out) 5 Vp(in) 5 14.1 V
The dc load voltage is:
Vdc 5   Vp ___ /H9266   5   14.1 V ______  /H9266   5 4.49 V
With the second approximation, we get a peak load voltage of:
Vp(out) 5 Vp(in) 2 0.7 V 5 14.1 V 2 0.7 V 5 13.4 V
and a dc load voltage of:
Vdc 5   Vp ___ /H9266   5   13.4 V ______  /H9266   5 4.27 V
Figure 4-3 shows you the values that an oscilloscope and a multimeter will read. Channel 1 of the oscilloscope is 
set at 5 V per major division (5 V/Div). The half-wave signal has a peak value between 13 and 14 V , which agrees with the 
result from our second approximation. The multimeter also gives good agreement with theoretical values because it reads 
approximately 4.22 V .
PRACTICE PROBLEM 4-1   Using Fig. 4-3, change the ac source voltage to 15 V . Calculate the second approxima-
tion dc load voltage Vdc.92 Chapter 4 secondary. If the secondary dot were on the ground end, the secondary voltage 
would be 180° out of phase with the primary voltage.
On the positive half-cycle of primary voltage, the secondary winding has 
a positive half sine wave across it and the diode is forward biased. On the negative 
half-cycle of primary voltage, the secondary winding has a negative half-cycle 
and the diode is reverse biased. Assuming an ideal diode, we will get a half-wave 
load voltage.
Turns Ratio
Recall from your earlier course work the following derivation:
V2 5 V1 ______ N1/N2   (4-5)
This says that the secondary voltage equals the primary voltage divided by the 
turns ratio. Sometimes you will see this equivalent form:
V2 5   N2 ___ N1  
 V1
This says that the secondary voltage equals the inverse turns ratio times the pri-
mary voltage.
You can use either formula for rms, peak values, and instantaneous volt-
ages. Most of the time, we will use Eq. (4-5) with rms values because ac source 
voltages are almost always specifi  ed as rms values.
The terms step up  and step down  are also encountered when dealing with 
transformers. These terms always relate the secondary voltage to the primary volt-
age. This means that a step-up transformer will produce a secondary voltage that 
is larger than the primary, and a step-down transformer will produce a secondary 
voltage that is smaller than the primary.120 V

Figure 4-6 a shows a full-wave rectifi  er circuit. Notice the grounded center tap 
on the secondary winding. The full-wave rectifi  er is equivalent to two half-wave 
rectifi  ers. Because of the center tap, each of these rectifi  ers has an input voltage 
equal to half the secondary voltage. Diode D1 conducts on the positive half-cycle, 
and diode D2 conducts on the negative half-cycle. As a result, the rectifi  ed load 
current fl  ows during both half-cycles. The full-wave rectifi  er acts the same as two 
back-to-back half-wave rectifi  ers.
Figure 4-6 b shows the equivalent circuit for the positive half-cycle. As 
you see, D1 is forward biased. This produces a positive load voltage as indicated 
by the plus-minus polarity across the load resistor. Figure 4-6 c shows the equiva-
lent circuit for the negative half-cycle. This time, D2 is forward biased. As you can 
see, this also produces a positive load voltage.
During both half-cycles, the load voltage has the same polarity and the 
load current is in the same direction. The circuit is called a full-wave rectifi  er
because it has changed the ac input voltage to the pulsating dc output voltage 
shown in Fig. 4-6 d. This waveform has some interesting properties that we will 
now  discuss.
SOLUTION  The transformer has a turns ratio of 5 ;1. This means that the rms 
secondary voltage is one-fi  fth of the primary voltage:
V2 5   120 V ______  5   5 24 V
and the peak secondary voltage is:
Vp 5   24 V _____ 0.707   5 34 V
With an ideal diode, the peak load voltage is:
Vp(out) 5 34 V
The dc load voltage is:
Vdc 5   Vp ___ /H9266   5   34 V ____ /H9266   5 10.8 V
With the second approximation, the peak load voltage is:
Vp(out) 5 34 V 2 0.7 V 5 33.3 V
and the dc load voltage is:
Vdc 5   Vp ___ /H9266   5   33.3 V ______  /H9266   5 10.6 V

turns ratio to 2:1 and solve for the ideal dc load voltage.94 Chapter 4RLD1

Since the full-wave signal has twice as many positive cycles as the half-wave 
 signal, the dc or average value is twice as much, given by:
Full wave: Vdc 5   2Vp ____ /H9266   (4-6)
Since 2/ /H9266 5 0.636, you may see Eq. (4-6) written as:
Vdc < 0.636 Vp
In this form, you can see that the dc or average value equals 63.6 percent of the 
peak value. For instance, if the peak voltage of the full-wave signal is 100 V , the 
dc voltage or average value is 63.6 V .
Output Frequency
With a half-wave rectifi  er, the output frequency equals the input frequency. But with 
a full-wave rectifi  er, something unusual happens to the output frequency. The ac line 
voltage has a frequency of 60 Hz. Therefore, the input period equals:
Tin 5   1 __ f   5   1 ______ 60 Hz   5 16.7 ms
Because of the full-wave rectifi  cation, the period of the full-wave signal 
is half the input period:
Tout 5 0.5(16.7 ms) 5 8.33 ms
(If there is any doubt in your mind, compare Fig. 4-6 d to Fig. 4-2 c.) When we 
 calculate the output frequency, we get:
fout 5   1 ____ Tout   5   1 _______ 8.33 ms   5 120 Hz
The frequency of the full-wave signal is double the input frequency. This 
makes sense. A full-wave output has twice as many cycles as the sine-wave input 
has. The full-wave rectifi  er inverts each negative half-cycle so that we get double the 
number of positive half-cycles. The effect is to double the frequency. As a  derivation:
Full wave: fout 5 2fin (4-7)
Second Approximation
Since the full-wave rectifi  er is like two back-to-back half-wave rectifi  ers, we can use 
the second approximation given earlier. The idea is to subtract 0.7 V from the ideal 
peak output voltage. The following example will illustrate the idea.GOOD TO KNOW
The rms value of a full-wave 
signal is Vrms 5 0.707  Vp, which 
is the same as Vrms for a full sine 
wave.
Application Example  4-3
Figure 4-7 shows a full-wave rectifi  er that you can build on a lab bench or on a computer screen with Multisim. Channel 1 of 
the oscilloscope displays the primary voltage (the sine wave), and channel 2 displays the load voltage (the full-wave signal). 
Set Channel 1 as your positive input trigger point. Most oscilloscopes will need a 10 3 probe to measure the higher input 
voltage level. Calculate the peak input and output voltages. Then compare the theoretical values to the measured values.
SOLUTION
The peak primary voltage is:
Vp(1) 5   Vrms _____ 0.707   5   120 V ______ 0.707   5 170 V96 Chapter 4
Because of the 10 ;1 step-down transformer, the peak secondary voltage is:
Vp(2) 5   Vp(1) _____ N1/N2   5   170 V ______ 10   5 17 V
The full-wave rectifi  er acts like two back-to-back half-wave rectifi  ers. Because of the center tap, the input voltage 
to each half-wave rectifi  er is only half the secondary voltage:
Vp(in) 5 0.5(17 V) 5 8.5 V
Ideally, the output voltage is:
Vp(out) 5 8.5 V
Using the second approximation:
Vp(out) 5 8.5 V 2 0.7 V 5 7.8 V
Now, let’s compare the theoretical values with the measured values. The sensitivity of channel 1 is 50 V/Div. Since 
the sine-wave input reads  approximately 3.4 divisions, its peak value is approximately 170 V . Channel 2 has a  sensitivity Figure 4-7  Lab example of full-wave rectiﬁ  er.
Diode Circuits 974-4 The Bridge Rectiﬁ  er
Figure 4-8 a shows a bridge rectifi  er circuit. The bridge rectifi  er is similar to a 
full-wave rectifi  er because it produces a full-wave output voltage. Diodes D1 and 
D2 conduct on the positive half-cycle, and D3 and D4 conduct on the negative 
half-cycle. As a result, the rectifi  ed load current fl  ows during both half-cycles.
Figure 4-8 b shows the equivalent circuit for the positive half-cycle. As 
you can see, D1 and D2 are forward biased. This produces a positive load voltage 
as indicated by the plus-minus polarity across the load resistor. As a memory aid, 
visualize D2 shorted. Then, the circuit that remains is a half-wave rectifi  er, which 
we are already familiar with.
Figure 4-8 c shows the equivalent circuit for the negative half-cycle. This 
time, D3 and D4 are forward biased. This also produces a positive load voltage. If 
you visualize D3 shorted, the circuit looks like a half-wave rectifi  er. So the bridge 
rectifi  er acts like two back-to-back half-wave rectifi  ers.
During both half-cycles, the load voltage has the same polarity and the 
load current is in the same direction. The circuit has changed the ac input volt-
age to the pulsating dc output voltage shown in Fig. 4-8 d. Note the advantage of 
this type of full-wave rectifi  cation over the center-tapped version in the previous 
 section: The entire secondary voltage can be used.
Figure 4-8 e shows bridge rectifi  er packages that contain all four diodes.
Average Value and Output Frequency
Because a bridge rectifi  er produces a full-wave output, the equations for average 
value and output frequency are the same as those given for a full-wave rectifi  er:
Vdc 5   2Vp ____ /H9266  
of 5 V/Div. Since the full-wave output reads approximately 1.4 Div, its peak value is approximately 7 V . Both input and 
output readings are in reasonable agreement with theoretical values.
Once again, notice that the second approximation improves the answer only slightly. If you were troubleshooting, 
the improvement would not be of much value. If something was wrong with the circuit, the chances are that the full-wave 
output would be drastically different from the ideal value of 8.5 V .
PRACTICE PROBLEM 4-3   Using Fig. 4-7, change the transformer’s turns ratio to 5:1 and calculate the Vp(in) and 
Vp(out) second approximation values.
Application Example  4-4
If one of the diodes in Fig. 4-7 were open, what would happen to the different voltages?
SOLUTION   If one of the diodes is open, the circuit reverts to a half-wave rectifi  er. In this case, half the secondary 
 voltage is still 8.5 V , but the load  voltage will be a half-wave signal rather than a full-wave signal. This half-wave voltag e 
will still have a peak of 8.5 V (ideally) or 7.8 V (second  approximation).98 Chapter 4and
fout 5 2fin
The average value is 63.6 percent of the peak value, and the output frequency is 
120 Hz, given a line frequency of 60 Hz.
One advantage of a bridge rectifi  er is that all the secondary voltage is 
used as the input to the rectifi  er. Given the same transformer, we get twice as 
much peak voltage and twice as much dc voltage with a bridge rectifi  er as with a 
full-wave rectifi  er. Doubling the dc output voltage compensates for having to use 
two extra diodes. As a rule, you will see the bridge rectifi  er used a lot more than 
the full-wave rectifi  er.RLV1N1:N2

packages.GOOD TO KNOW
When a bridge rectifier, as 
 opposed to a two-diode full-
wave rectifier, is used, the 
same dc output voltage can be 
 obtained with a transformer that 
has a higher turns ratio N1/N2. 
This means that with a bridge 
rectifier, fewer turns of wire 
are needed in the transformer. 
Therefore, the transformer used 
with a bridge rectifier versus 
a two-diode full-wave rectifier 
will be small and lighter and will 
cost less. This benefit alone out-
weighs using four diodes instead 
of two in a conventional two-
diode full-wave rectifier.Diode Circuits 99Incidentally, the full-wave rectifi  er was in use for many years before the 
bridge rectifi  er was used. For this reason, it has retained the name full-wave rec-
tifi  er  even though a bridge rectifi  er also has a full-wave output. To distinguish the 
full-wave rectifi  er from the bridge rectifi  er, some literature may refer to a full-
wave rectifi  er as a conventional full-wave rectifi  er,  a two-diode full-wave rectifi  er,
or a center-tapped full-wave rectifi  er.
Second Approximation and Other Losses
Since the bridge rectifi  er has two diodes in the conducting path, the peak output 
voltage is given by:
2d bridge: Vp(out) 5 Vp(in) 2 1.4 V (4-8)
As you can see, we have to subtract two diode drops from the peak to get a more 
accurate value of peak load voltage. Summary Table 4-1 compares the three rec-
tifi  ers and their properties.

Diode Circuits 1014-5 The Choke-Input Filter
At one time, the choke-input fi  lter was widely used to fi  lter the output of a rectifi  er. 
Although not used much anymore because of its cost, bulk, and weight, this type 
of fi  lter has instructional value and helps make it easier to understand other fi  lters.
Basic Idea
Look at Fig. 4-10 a. This type of fi  lter is called a choke-input fi  lter.  The ac source 
produces a current in the inductor, capacitor, and resistor. The ac current in each 
component depends on the inductive reactance, capacitive reactance, and the 
 resistance. The inductor has a reactance given by:
XL 5 2/H9266fL
The capacitor has a reactance given by:
XC 5   1 _____ 2/H9266fC  
As you learned in previous courses, the choke (or inductor) has the primary char-
acteristic of opposing a change in current. Because of this, a choke-input fi  lter ide-
ally reduces the ac current in the load resistor to zero. To a second approximation, 
it reduces the ac load current to a very small value. Let us fi  nd out why.
The fi  rst requirement of a well-designed choke-input fi  lter is to have XC
at the input frequency be much smaller than RL. When this condition is satisfi  ed, 
we can ignore the load resistance and use the equivalent circuit of Fig. 4-10 b. The 
second requirement of a well-designed choke-input fi  lter is to have XL be much 
greater than XC at the input frequency. When this condition is satisfi  ed, the ac 
 output voltage approaches zero. On the other hand, since the choke approximates 
a short circuit at 0 Hz and the capacitor approximates an open at 0 Hz, the dc cur-
rent can be passed to the load resistance with minimum loss.
To a second approximation:
Vp(out) 5 17 V 2 1.4 V 5 15.6 V
Now, let’s compare the theoretical values with the measured values. The sensitivity of channel 1 is 50 V/Div. Since 
the sine-wave input reads approximately 3.4 Div, its peak value is approximately 170 V . Channel 2 has a sensitivity of 
5 V/Div. Since the half-wave output reads approximately 3.2 Div, its peak value is approximately 16 V . Both input and 
 output readings are approximately the same as the theoretical values.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 4-5   As in Application Example 4-5, calculate the ideal and second approximation Vp(out) 
values using a 5:1 transformer turns ratio.

(b)Figure 4-10  (a) Choke-input ﬁ  lter; ( b) ac-equivalent circuit.102 Chapter 4In Fig. 4-10 b, the circuit acts like a reactive voltage divider. When XL is 
much greater than XC, almost all the ac voltage is dropped across the choke. In this 
case, the ac output voltage equals:
Vout /H11015   XC ___ XL   Vin (4-9)
For instance, if XL 5 10 k V, XC 5 100 V, and Vin 5 15 V , the ac output voltage is:
Vout <   100 V ______ 10 kV   15 V 5 0.15 V
In this example, the choke-input fi  lter reduces the ac voltage by a factor of 100.
Filtering the Output of a Rectiﬁ  er
Figure 4-11 a shows a choke-input fi  lter between a rectifi  er and a load. The rec-
tifi er can be a half-wave, full-wave, or bridge type. What effect does the choke- 
input fi  lter have on the load voltage? The easiest way to solve this problem is to 
use the superposition theorem. Recall what this theorem says: If you have two or

ripple.Diode Circuits 103more sources, you can analyze the circuit for each source separately and then add 
the individual voltages to get the total voltage.
The rectifi  er output has two different components: a dc voltage (the 
 average value) and an ac voltage (the fl  uctuating part), as shown in Fig. 4-11 b. 
Each of these voltages acts like a separate source. As far as the ac voltage is con-
cerned, XL is much greater than XC, and this results in very little ac voltage across 
the load resistor. Even though the ac component is not a pure sine wave, Eq. (4-9) 
is still a close approximation for the ac load voltage.
The circuit acts like Fig. 4-11 c as far as dc voltage is concerned. At 0 Hz, 
the inductive reactance is zero and the capacitive reactance is infi  nite. Only the 
 series resistance of the inductor windings remains. Making RS much smaller than 
RL causes most of the dc component to appear across the load resistor.
That’s how a choke-input fi  lter works: Almost all of the dc component is 
passed on to the load resistor, and almost all of the ac component is blocked. In this 
way, we get an almost perfect dc voltage, one that is almost constant, like the volt-
age out of a battery. Figure 4-11 d shows the fi  ltered output for a full-wave signal. 
The only deviation from a perfect dc voltage is the small ac load voltage shown in 
Fig. 4-11 d. This small ac load voltage is called ripple.  With an oscilloscope, we can 
measure its peak-to-peak value. To measure the ripple value, set the oscilloscope’s 
vertical input coupling switch or setting to ac instead of dc. This will allow you to 
see the ac component of the waveform while blocking the dc or average value.
Main Disadvantage
A power supply  is the circuit inside electronics equipment that converts the ac 
input voltage to an almost perfect dc output voltage. It includes a rectifi  er and a 
fi lter. The trend nowadays is toward low-voltage, high-current power supplies. 
Because line frequency is only 60 Hz, large inductances have to be used to get 
enough reactance for adequate fi  ltering. But large inductors have large winding 
resistances, which create a serious design problem with large load currents. In 
other words, too much dc voltage is dropped across the choke resistance. Further-
more, bulky inductors are not suitable for modern semiconductor circuits, where 
the emphasis is on lightweight designs.
Switching Regulators
One important application does exist for the choke-input fi  lter. A switching r egula-
tor is a special kind of power supply used in computers, monitors, and an increas-
ing variety of equipment. The frequency used in a switching regulator is much 
higher than 60 Hz. Typically, the frequency being fi  ltered is above 20 kHz. At this 
much higher frequency, we can use much smaller inductors to design effi  cient 
choke-input fi  lters. We will discuss the details in a later chapter.
4-6 The Capacitor-Input Filter
The choke-input fi  lter produces a dc output voltage equal to the average value 
of the rectifi  ed voltage. The capacitor-input fi  lter produces a dc output voltage 
equal to the peak value of the rectifi  ed voltage. This type of fi  lter is the most 
widely used in power supplies.
Basic Idea
Figure 4-12 a shows an ac source, a diode, and a capacitor. The key to understand-
ing a capacitor-input fi  lter is understanding what this simple circuit does during 
the fi  rst quarter-cycle.104 Chapter 4Initially, the capacitor is uncharged. During the fi  rst quarter-cycle of 
Fig. 4-12 b, the diode is forward biased. Since it ideally acts like a closed switch, the 
capacitor charges, and its voltage equals the source voltage at each instant of the fi  rst 
quarter-cycle. The charging continues until the input reaches its maximum value. At 
this point, the capacitor voltage equals Vp.
After the input voltage reaches the peak, it starts to decrease. As soon as 
the input voltage is less than Vp, the diode turns off. In this case, it acts like the 
open switch of Fig. 4-12 c. During the remaining cycles, the capacitor stays fully 
charged and the diode remains open. This is why the output voltage of Fig. 4-12 b 
is constant and equal to Vp.
Ideally, all that the capacitor-input fi  lter does is charge the capacitor to 
the peak voltage during the fi  rst quarter-cycle. This peak voltage is constant, the 
perfect dc voltage we need for electronics equipment. There’s only one problem: 
There is no load resistor.
Eff  ect of Load Resistor
For the capacitor-input fi  lter to be useful, we need to connect a load resistor across 
the capacitor, as shown in Fig. 4-13 a. As long as the RLC time constant is much 
greater than the period, the capacitor remains almost fully charged and the load 
voltage is approximately Vp. The only deviation from a perfect dc voltage is the 
small ripple seen in Fig. 4-13 b. The smaller the peak-to-peak value of this ripple, 
the more closely the output approaches a perfect dc voltage.
Between peaks, the diode is off and the capacitor discharges through the 
load resistor. In other words, the capacitor supplies the load current. Since the 
 capacitor discharges only slightly between peaks, the peak-to-peak ripple is small. 
When the next peak arrives, the diode conducts briefl  y and recharges the capacitor 
to the peak value. A key question is: What size should the capacitor be for proper 
operation? Before discussing capacitor size, consider what happens with the other 
rectifi  er circuits.
Full-Wave Filtering
If we connect a full-wave or bridge rectifi  er to a capacitor-input fi  lter, the peak-
to-peak ripple is cut in half. Figure 4-13 c shows why. When a full-wave voltage is (b)Vp

(c) capacitor remains charged when diode is off  .Diode Circuits 105 applied to the RC circuit, the capacitor discharges for only half as long. Therefore, 
the peak-to-peak ripple is half the size it would be with a half-wave rectifi  er.
The Ripple Formula
Here is a derivation we will use to estimate the peak-to-peak ripple out of any 
 capacitor-input fi  lter:
VR 5   I ___ fC   (4-10)
where VR 5 peak-to-peak ripple voltage
I 5 dc load current
f 5 ripple frequency
C 5 capacitance
This is an approximation, not an exact derivation. We can use this formula to 
 estimate the peak-to-peak ripple. When a more accurate answer is needed, one 
 solution is to use a computer with a circuit simulator like Multisim.
For instance, if the dc load current is 10 mA and the capacitance is 
200 /H9262F, the ripple with a bridge rectifi  er and a capacitor-input fi  lter is:
VR 5   10 mA _______________   (120 Hz)(200 /H9262F)   5 0.417 V p-p
When using this derivation, remember two things. First, the ripple is in 
peak-to-peak (p-p) voltage. This is useful because you normally measure ripple 
voltage with an oscilloscope. Second, the formula works with half-wave or full-wave 
voltages. Use 60 Hz for half wave, and 120 Hz for full wave.
You should use an oscilloscope for ripple measurements if one is availa-
ble. If not, you can use an ac voltmeter, although there will be a signifi  cant error 
in the measurement. Most ac voltmeters are calibrated to read the rms value of a 
sine wave. Since the ripple is not a sine wave, you may get a measurement error 
of as much as 25 percent, depending on the design of the ac voltmeter. But this 
should be no problem when you are troubleshooting, since you will be looking for 
much larger changes in ripple.(c)Vp(b)pV

GOOD TO KNOW
Another, more accurate formula 
can be used to determine the 
ripple out of any capacitor input 
filter. It is
VR /H11005 Vp(out) (1 2 /H92802tyRLC)
Time t represents the length of 
time the filter capacitor C is 
 allowed to discharge. For a 
half-wave rectifier, t can be ap-
proximated as 16.67 ms, whereas 
8.33 ms can be used for a full-wave 
rectiﬁ  er.106 Chapter 4
If you do use an ac voltmeter to measure the ripple, you can convert 
the peak-to-peak value given by Eq. (4-10) to an rms value using the following 
 formula for a sine wave:
Vrms 5   Vp-p ____ 2 Ï—
 2    
Dividing by 2 converts the peak-to-peak value to a peak value, and dividing by 
Ï—
2   gives the rms value of a sine wave with the same peak-to-peak value as the 
ripple voltage.
Exact DC Load Voltage
It is diffi  cult to calculate the exact dc load voltage in a bridge rectifi  er with a 
 capacitor-input fi  lter. To begin with, we have the two diode drops that are sub-
tracted from the peak voltage. Besides the diode drops, an additional voltage drop 
occurs, as follows: The diodes conduct heavily when recharging the capacitor 
 because they are on for only a short time during each cycle. This brief but large 
current has to fl  ow through the transformer windings and the bulk resistance of 
the diodes. In our examples, we will calculate either the ideal output or the output 
with the second approximation of a diode, remembering that the actual dc voltage 
is slightly lower.
Example 4-6
What is the dc load voltage and ripple in Fig. 4-14?
SOLUTION  The rms secondary voltage is:
V2 5   120 V ______  5   5 24 V
The peak secondary voltage is:
Vp 5   24 V _____ 0.707   5 34 V
Assuming an ideal diode and small ripple, the dc load voltage is:
VL 5 34 V
To calculate the ripple, we fi  rst need to get the dc load current:
IL 5   VL ___ RL   5   34 V _____ 5 kV   5 6.8 mA

Now we can use Eq. (4-10) to get:
VR 5   6.8 mA ______________   (60 Hz)(100 /H9262F)   5 1.13 V p-p < 1.1 V p-p
We rounded the ripple to two signifi  cant digits because it is an approximation and 
cannot be accurately measured with an oscilloscope with greater precision.
Here is how to improve the answer slightly: There is about 0.7 V across 
a silicon diode when it is conducting. Therefore, the peak voltage across the load 
will be closer to 33.3 V than to 34 V . The ripple also lowers the dc voltage slightly. 
So the actual dc load voltage will be closer to 33 V than to 34 V . But these are 
minor deviations. Ideal answers are usually adequate for troubleshooting and pre-
liminary analysis.
A fi  nal point about the circuit. The plus and minus signs on the fi  lter 
capacitor  indicates a polarized capacitor,  one whose plus side must be connected 
to the positive rectifi  er output. In Fig. 4-15, the plus sign on the capacitor case is 
correctly connected to the positive output voltage. You must look carefully at the 
capacitor case when you are building or troubleshooting a circuit to fi  nd out whether 
it is polarized or not. If you reverse the polarity of the rectifi  er diodes and build a 
negative power-supply circuit, be sure to connect the capacitor’s negative side to 
the negative output voltage point and the positive capacitor side to circuit ground.
Power supplies often use polarized electrolytic capacitors because this 
type can provide high values of capacitance in small packages. As discussed in 
earlier courses, electrolytic capacitors must be connected with the correct polar-
ity to produce the oxide fi  lm. If an electrolytic capacitor is connected in opposite 
polarity, it becomes hot and may explode.
Example 4-7
What is the dc load voltage and ripple in Fig. 4-15?
SOLUTION  Since the transformer is 5:1 step-down like the preceding  example, 
the peak secondary voltage is still 34 V . Half this voltage is the input to each half-
wave section. Assuming an ideal diode and small ripple, the dc load voltage is:
VL 5 17 V
The dc load current is:

Example 4-8
What is the dc load voltage and ripple in Fig. 4-16? Compare the answers with 
those in the two preceding examples.
SOLUTION  Since the transformer is 5 ;1 step-down as in the preceding ex-
ample, the peak secondary voltage is still 34 V . Assuming an ideal diode and small 
ripple, the dc load voltage is:
VL 5 34 V
The dc load current is:
IL 5   34 V _____  5 kV   5 6.8 mA
Now, Eq. (4-10) gives:
VR 5   6.8 mA  ________________    (120 Hz)(100 /H9262F)   5 0.566 V p-p < 0.57 V p-p
Because of the 1.4 V across two conducting diodes and the ripple, the actual dc 
load voltage will be closer to 32 V than to 34 V .
We have calculated the dc load voltage and ripple for the three different 
rectifi  ers. Here are the results:
Half-wave: 34 V and 1.13 V
Full-wave: 17 V and 0.288 V
Bridge: 34 V and 0.566 V
For a given transformer, the bridge rectifi  er is better than the half-wave rectifi  er 
because it has less ripple, and it’s better than the full-wave rectifi  er because it pro-
duces twice as much output voltage. Of the three, the bridge rectifi  er has emerged 
as the most popular.

Figure 4-17  Lab example of bridge rectiﬁ  er and capacitor-input ﬁ  lter.110 Chapter 44-7  Peak Inverse Voltage and 
Surge Current
The peak inverse voltage (PIV)  is the maximum voltage across the nonconduct-
ing diode of a rectifi  er. This voltage must be less than the breakdown voltage of the 
diode; otherwise, the diode will be destroyed.  The peak inverse voltage depends 
on the type of rectifi  er and fi  lter. The worst case occurs with the capacitor-input 
fi lter.
As discussed earlier, data sheets from various manufacturers use many 
different symbols to indicate the maximum reverse voltage rating of a diode. 
Sometimes, these symbols indicate different conditions of measurement. Some of 
the data sheet symbols for the maximum reverse voltage rating are PIV , PRV , VB, 
VBR, VR, VRRM, VRWM, and VR(max). 
Half-Wave Rectiﬁ  er with Capacitor-Input Filter
Figure 4-18 a shows the critical part of a half-wave rectifi  er. This is the part of the 
circuit that determines how much reverse voltage is across the diode. The rest of 
the circuit has no effect and is omitted for the sake of clarity. In the worst case, the 
peak secondary voltage is on the negative peak and the capacitor is fully charged 
SOLUTION   The transformer is a 15 ;1 step-down, so the rms secondary  voltage is:
V2 5   120 V ______ 15   5
 8 V
and the peak secondary voltage is:
Vp 5   8 V _____ 0.707   5 11.3 V
Let’s use the second approximation of the diodes to get the dc load voltage:
VL 5 11.3 V 2 1.4 V 5 9.9 V
To calculate the ripple, we fi  rst need to get the dc load current:
IL 5   9.9 V ______ 500 V   5 19.8 mA
Now, we can use Eq. (4-10) to get:
VR 5   19.8 mA  ________________   (120 Hz)(4700 /H9262F)   5 35 mV p-p
In Fig. 4-17, a multimeter reads a dc load voltage of approximately 9.9 V .
Channel 1 of the oscilloscope is set to 10 mV/Div. The peak-to-peak ripple is approximately 2.9 Div, and the 
 measured ripple is 29.3 mV . This is less than the theoretical value of 35 mV , which emphasizes the point made earlier. Equa-
tion (4-10) is to be used for estimating  ripple. If you need more accuracy, use computer simulation software.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 4-9   Change the capacitor value in Fig. 4-17 to 1000 mF. Calculate the new VR value.Diode Circuits 111with a voltage of Vp. Apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law, and you can see right away 
that the peak inverse voltage across the nonconducting diode is:
PIV 5 2Vp (4-11)
For instance, if the peak secondary voltage is 15 V , the peak inverse voltage is 
30 V . As long as the breakdown voltage of the diode is greater than this, the diode 
will not be damaged. 
Full-Wave Rectiﬁ  er with Capacitor-Input Filter
Figure 4-18 b shows the essential part of a full-wave rectifi  er needed to calculate 
the peak inverse voltage. Again, the secondary voltage is at the negative peak. In 
this case, the lower diode acts like a short (closed switch) and the upper diode is 
open. Kirchhoff’s law implies:
PIV 5 Vp (4-12)
Bridge Rectiﬁ  er with Capacitor-Input Filter
Figure 4-18 c shows part of a bridge rectifi  er. This is all you need to calculate the 
peak inverse voltage. Since the upper diode is shorted and the lower one is open, 
the peak inverse voltage across the lower diode is:
PIV 5 Vp (4-13)
Another advantage of the bridge rectifi  er is that it has the lowest peak inverse 
voltage for a given load voltage. To produce the same load voltage, the full-wave 
rectifi  er would need twice as much secondary voltage.
Surge Resistor
Before the power is turned on, the fi  lter capacitor is uncharged. At the fi  rst instant 
the power is applied, this capacitor looks like a short. Therefore, the initial charg-
ing current may be very large. All that exists in the charging path to impede the 
current is the resistance of the transformer windings and the bulk resistance of the 
diodes. The initial rush of current when the power is turned on is called the surge 
current.
Ordinarily, the designer of the power supply will select a diode with 
enough current rating to withstand the surge current. The key to the surge current 
is the size of the fi  lter capacitor. Occasionally, a designer may decide to use a 
surge resistor rather than select another diode.
Figure 4-19 illustrates the idea. A small resistor is inserted between the 
bridge rectifi  er and the capacitor-input fi  lter. Without the resistor, the surge cur-
rent might destroy the diodes. By including the surge resistor, the designer re-
duces the surge current to a safe level. Surge resistors are not used very often and 
are mentioned just in case you see one used in a power supply.Vp

Example 4-10
What is the peak inverse voltage in Fig. 4-19 if the turns ratio is 8:1? A 1N4001 
has a breakdown voltage of 50 V . Is it safe to use a 1N4001 in this circuit?
SOLUTION  The rms secondary voltage is:
V2 5   120 V ______  8   5 15 V
The peak secondary voltage is:
Vp 5   15 V _____ 0.707   5 21.2 V
The peak inverse voltage is:
PIV 5 21.2 V
The 1N4001 is more than adequate, since the peak inverse voltage is much less 
than the breakdown voltage of 50 V .

turns ratio to 2:1. Which 1N4000 series of diodes should you use?
4-8 Other Power-Supply Topics
You have a basic idea of how power-supply circuits work. In the preceding sec-
tions, you have seen how an ac input voltage is rectifi  ed and fi  ltered to get a dc 
voltage. There are a few additional ideas you need to know about.
Commercial Transformers
The use of turns ratios with transformers applies only to ideal transformers. Iron-
core transformers are different. In other words, the transformers you buy from a 
parts supplier are not ideal because the windings have resistance, which produces 
power losses. Furthermore, the laminated core has eddy currents, which produce 
additional power losses. Because of these unwanted power losses, the turns ratio 
is only an approximation. In fact, the data sheets for transformers rarely list the 
turns ratio. Usually, all you get is the secondary voltage at a rated current.
For instance, Fig. 4-20 a shows an F-25X, an industrial transformer 
whose data sheet gives only the following specifi  cations: for a primary voltage of 
115 V ac, the secondary voltage is 12.6 V ac when the secondary current is 1.5 A. 
If the secondary current is less than 1.5 A in Fig. 4-20 a, the secondary voltage 
will be more than 12.6 V ac because of lower power losses in the windings and 
laminated core.
If it is necessary to know the primary current, you can estimate the turns 
ratio of a real transformer by using this defi  nition:
N1 ___ N2   5   V1 ___ V2   (4-14)GOOD TO KNOW
When a transformer is unloaded, 
the secondary voltage usually 
measures a value that is 5 to 
10 percent higher than its rated 
value.Diode Circuits 113For instance, the F25X has V1 5 115 V and V2 5 12.6 V . The turns ratio at the 
rated load current of 1.5 A is:
N1 ___ N2   5   115 ____ 12.6   5 9.13
This is an approximation because the calculated turns ratio decreases when the 
load current decreases.
Calculating Fuse Current
When troubleshooting, you may need to calculate the primary current to deter-
mine whether a fuse is adequate or not. The easiest way to do this with a real 
transformer is to assume that the input power equals the output power: Pin 5 Pout. 
For instance, Fig. 4-20 b shows a fused transformer driving a fi  ltered rectifi  er. Is 
the 0.1-A fuse adequate?
Here is how to estimate the primary current when troubleshooting. The 
output power equals the dc load power:
Pout 5 VI 5 (15 V)(1.2 A) 5 18 W
Ignore the power losses in the rectifi  er and the transformer. Since the input power 
must equal the output power:
Pin 5 18 W
Since Pin 5 V1I1, we can solve for the primary current:
I1 5   18 W ______ 115 V   5 0.156 A
This is only an estimate because we ignored the power losses in the transformer 
and rectifi  er. The actual primary current will be higher by about 5 to 20 percent 
because of these additional losses. In any case, the fuse is inadequate. It should 
be at least 0.25 A.
Slow-Blow Fuses
Assume that a capacitor-input fi  lter is used in Fig. 4-20 b. If an ordinary 0.25-A 
fuse is used in Fig. 4-20 b, it will blow out when you turn the power on. The  reason 
is the surge current, described earlier. Most power supplies use a slow-blow fuse, 115 V

slow-blow fuse can withstand
2 A for 0.1 s
1.5 A for 1 s
1 A for 2 s
and so on. With a slow-blow fuse, the circuit has time to charge the capacitor. Then, 
the primary current drops down to its normal level with the fuse still intact.
Calculating Diode Current
Whether a half-wave rectifi  er is fi  ltered or not, the average current through the 
diode has to equal the dc load current because there is only one path for current. 
As a derivation:
Half wave: Idiode 5 Idc (4-15)
On the other hand, the average current through a diode in the full-wave 
rectifi  er equals only half the dc load current because there are two diodes in the 
circuit, each sharing the load. Similarly, each diode in a bridge rectifi  er has to 
withstand an average current of half the dc load current. As a derivation:
Full wave: Idiode 5 0.5Idc (4-16)
Summary Table 4-2 compares the properties of the three capacitor-input fi  ltered 
rectifi  ers.
Reading a Data Sheet
Refer to the data sheet of the 1N4001 in Chap. 3, Fig. 3-15. The maximum peak 
repetitive reverse voltage, VRRM on the data sheet, is the same as the peak inverse 
voltage discussed earlier. The data sheet says that the 1N4001 can withstand a 
voltage of 50 V in the reverse direction.
The average rectifi  ed forward current— IF(av), I(max), or I0—is the dc or 
average current through the diode. For a half-wave rectifi  er, the diode current 
equals the dc load current. For a full-wave or bridge rectifi  er, it equals half the 
dc load current. The data sheet says that a 1N4001 can have a dc current of 1 A, 
which means that the dc load current can be as much as 2 A in a bridge rectifi  er. 
Notice also the surge-current rating IFSM. The data sheet says that a 1N4001 can 
withstand 30 A during the fi  rst cycle when the power is turned on.

Before the 1970s, passive fi  lters  (R, L, and C components) were often connected 
between the rectifi  er and the load resistance. Nowadays, you rarely see passive 
 fi lters used in semiconductor power supplies, but there might be special applica-
tions, such as audio power amplifi  ers, in which you might encounter them.
Figure 4-21 a shows a bridge rectifi  er and a capacitor-input fi  lter. Usually, 
a designer will settle for a peak-to-peak ripple of as much as 10 percent across the 
fi lter capacitor. The reason for not trying to get even lower ripple is  because the 
fi lter capacitor would become too large. Additional fi  ltering is then done by RC
sections between the fi  lter capacitor and the load resistor.
The RC sections are examples of a passive fi  lter, one that uses only R, L, 
or C components. By deliberate design, R is much greater than XC at the ripple 
frequency. Therefore, the ripple is reduced before it reaches the load resistor. Typ-
ically, R is at least 10 times greater than XC. This means that each section attenu-
ates (reduces) the ripple by a factor of at least 10. The disadvantage of an RC fi lter 
is the loss of dc voltage across each R. Because of this, the RC fi  lter is suitable 
only for very light loads (small load current or large load resistance).
LC Filter
When the load current is large, the LC fi lters of Fig. 4-21 b are an improvement over 
RC fi lters. Again, the idea is to drop the ripple across the series components, in this 
case, the inductors. By making XL much greater than XC, we can reduce the ripple BRIDGE

GOOD TO KNOW
A filter made of an  inductor 
placed in  between two capaci-
tors is often called a pi ( p) filter.116 Chapter 4to a very low level. The dc voltage drop across the inductors is much smaller than 
it is across the resistors of RC sections because the winding resistance is smaller.
The LC fi lter was very popular at one time. Now, it’s becoming obsolete 
in typical power supplies because of the size and cost of inductors. For low-voltage 
power supplies, the LC fi  lter has been replaced by an integrated circuit (IC).  
This is a device that contains diodes, transistors, resistors, and other components 
in a miniaturized package to perform a specifi  c function.
Figure 4-21 c illustrates the idea. An IC voltage regulator,  one type of 
integrated circuit, is between the fi  lter capacitor and the load resistor. This device 
not only reduces the ripple, it also holds the output voltage constant. We will dis-
cuss specifi  c details of IC voltage regulators in a later chapter. Figure 4-21 d shows 
an example of a three-terminal voltage regulator. The LM7805 IC provides for a 
fi ve-volt fi  xed positive output voltage, as long as the input voltage to the IC is at 
least 2 to 3 volts greater than the required output voltage. Other regulators in the 
78XX series can regulate a range of output values, such as 9 V , 12 V , and 15 V . 
The 79XX series provides regulated negative output values. Because of their low 
cost, IC voltage regulators are now the standard method used for ripple reduction.
Summary Table 4-3 breaks the power supply down into functional blocks.
4-9 Troubleshooting
Almost every piece of electronics equipment has a power supply, typically a rectifi  er, 
driving a capacitor-input fi  lter followed by a voltage regulator. This power supply pro-
duces the dc voltages needed by transistors and other devices. If a piece of electronics 
equipment is not working properly, start your troubleshooting with the power supply. 
More often than not, equipment failure is caused by troubles in the power supply.
Procedure
Assume that you are troubleshooting the circuit of Fig. 4-22. You can start by 
measuring the dc load voltage. It should be approximately the same as the peak 
secondary voltage. If not, there are two possible courses of action.
First, if there is no load voltage, you can use a fl  oating VOM or DMM to 
measure the secondary voltage (ac range). The reading is the rms voltage across the 
secondary winding. Convert this to peak value. You can estimate the peak value by 
adding 40 percent to the rms value. If this is normal, the diodes may be defective. If 
there is no secondary voltage, either the fuse is blown or the transformer is defective.Purpose Provides proper

RLDiode Circuits 117Second, if there is dc load voltage but it is lower than it should be, look 
at the dc load voltage with an oscilloscope and measure the ripple. A peak-to-peak 
ripple around 10 percent of the ideal load voltage is reasonable. The ripple may be 
somewhat more or less than this, depending on the design. Furthermore, the rip-
ple frequency should be 120 Hz for a full-wave or bridge rectifi  er. If the ripple is 
60 Hz, one of the diodes may be open.
Common Troubles
Here are the most common troubles that arise in bridge rectifi  ers with capacitor-
input fi  lters:
 1. If the fuse is open, there will be no voltages anywhere in the circuit.
 2. If the fi  lter capacitor is open, the dc load voltage will be low because the 
output will be an unfi  ltered full-wave signal.
 3. If one of the diodes is open, the dc load voltage will be low because there 
will be only half-wave rectifi  cation. Also, the ripple frequency will be 60 Hz 
instead of 120 Hz. If all diodes are open, there will be no output. 
 4. If the load is shorted, the fuse will be blown. Possibly, one or more diodes 
may be ruined or the transformer may be damaged.
 5. Sometimes, the fi  lter capacitor becomes leaky with age, and this reduces the 
dc load voltage.
 6. Occasionally, shorted windings in the transformer reduce the dc output volt-
age. In this case, the transformer often feels very warm to the touch.
 7. Besides these troubles, you can have solder bridges, cold-solder joints, bad 
connections, and so on.

The diodes used in low-frequency power supplies are rectifi  er diodes.  These di-
odes are optimized for use at 60 Hz and have power ratings greater than 0.5 W. 
The typical rectifi  er diode has a forward current rating in amperes. Except for 
power supplies, rectifi  er diodes have little use because most circuits inside elec-
tronics equipment are running at much higher frequencies.
Example 4-11
When the circuit of Fig. 4-23 is working normally, it has an rms secondary voltage of 12.7 V , a load voltage of 18 V , and a 
peak-to-peak ripple of 318 mV . If the fi  lter capacitor is open, what happens to the dc load voltage?

SOLUTION  With an open fi  lter capacitor, the circuit reverts to a bridge rectifi  er with no fi  lter capacitor. Because there 
is no fi  ltering, an oscilloscope across the load will display a full-wave signal with a peak value of 18 V . The average value is 
63.6 percent of 18 V , which is 11.4 V .
Example 4-12
Suppose the load resistor of Fig. 4-23 is shorted. Describe the symptoms.
SOLUTION  A short across the load resistor will increase the current to a very high value. This will blow out the fuse. 
Furthermore, it is possible that one or more diodes will be destroyed before the fuse blows. Often, when one diode shorts, it 
will cause the other rectifi  er diodes to also short. Because of the blown fuse, all voltages will measure zero. When you check 
the fuse visually or with an ohmmeter, you will see that it is open.
With the power off, you should check the diodes with an ohmmeter to see whether any of them have been destroyed. 
You should also measure the load resistance with an ohmmeter. If it measures zero or very low, you have more troubles to 
locate.
The trouble could be a solder bridge across the load resistor, incorrect wiring, or any number of possibilities. Fuses 
do occasionally blow out without a permanent short across the load. But the point is this: When you get a blown fuse, check 
the diodes for possible damage and the load resistance for a possible short.
A troubleshooting exercise at the end of the chapter has eight different troubles, including open diodes, fi  lter capac-
itors, shorted loads, blown fuses, and open grounds.Diode Circuits 119Small-Signal Diodes
In this section, we will be using small-signal diodes.  These diodes are optimized 
for use at high frequencies and have power ratings less than 0.5 W. The typi-
cal small-signal diode has a current rating in milliamperes. It is this smaller and 
lighter construction that allows the diode to work at higher frequencies.
The Positive Clipper
A clipper  is a circuit that removes either positive or negative parts of a waveform. 
This kind of processing is useful for signal shaping, circuit protection, and com-
munications. Figure 4-24 a shows a positive clipper.  The circuit removes all the 
positive parts of the input signal. This is why the output signal has only negative 
half-cycles.
Here is how the circuit works: During the positive half-cycle, the diode 
turns on and looks like a short across the output terminals. Ideally, the output volt-
age is zero. On the negative half-cycle, the diode is open. In this case, a negative 
half-cycle appears across the output. By deliberate design, the series resistor is 
much smaller than the load resistor. This is why the negative output peak is shown 
as 2Vp in Fig. 4-24 a.
To a second approximation, the diode voltage is 0.7 V when conducting. 
Therefore, the clipping level is not zero, but 0.7 V . For instance, if the input signal 
has a peak value of 20 V , the output of the clipper will look like Fig. 4-24 b.
Deﬁ  ning Conditions
Small-signal diodes have a smaller junction area than rectifi  er diodes because 
they are optimized to work at higher frequencies. As a result, they have more bulk 
resistance. The data sheet of a small-signal diode like the 1N914 lists a forward 
current of 10 mA at 1 V . Therefore, the bulk resistance is:
RB 5   1 V 2 0.7 V ___________  10 mA   5 30 V
Why is bulk resistance important? Because the clipper will not work 
properly unless the series resistance RS is much greater than the bulk resistance. 
Furthermore, the clipper won’t work properly unless the series resistance RS is +Vp

this defi  nition:
Stiff clipper: 100 RB /H11021 RS /H11021 0.01RL (4-17)
This says that the series resistance must be 100 times greater than the bulk resist-
ance and 100 times smaller than the load resistance. When a clipper satisfi  es these 
conditions, we call it a stiff clipper.  For instance, if the diode has a bulk resistance 
of 30 V, the series resistance should be at least 3 k V and the load resistance 
should be at least 300 k V.
The Negative Clipper
If we reverse the polarity of the diode as shown in Fig. 4-25 a, we get a negative 
clipper.  As you would expect, this removes the negative parts of the signal. Ide-
ally, the output waveform has nothing but positive half-cycles.
The clipping is not perfect. Because of the diode offset voltage  (another 
way of saying barrier potential ), the clipping level is at 20.7 V . If the input signal 
has a peak of 20 V , the output signal will look like Fig. 4-25 b.
The Limiter or Diode Clamp
The clipper is useful for waveshaping, but the same circuit can be used in a  totally 
different way. Take a look at Fig. 4-26 a. The normal input to this circuit is a 
 signal with a peak of only 15 mV . Therefore, the normal output is the same signal 
 because neither diode is turned during the cycle.
What good is the circuit if the diodes don’t turn on? Whenever you have 
a sensitive circuit, one that cannot have too much input, you can use a positive- 
negative limiter  to protect its input, as shown in Fig. 4-26 b. If the input signal tries 
to rise above 0.7 V , the output is limited to 0.7 V . On the other hand, if the input 
signal tries to drop below 20.7 V , the output is limited to 20.7 V . In a circuit like 
this, normal operation means that the input signal is always smaller than 0.7 V in 
either polarity.
An example of a sensitive circuit is the op amp,  an IC that will be dis-
cussed in later chapters. The typical input voltage to an op amp is less than 15 mV . 
V oltages greater than 15 mV are unusual, and voltages greater than 0.7 V are 
abnormal. A limiter on the input side of an op amp will prevent excessive input 
voltage from being accidentally applied.(a)

GOOD TO KNOW
Negative diode clamps are 
often used on the inputs of 
 digital Transistor-Transistor 
Logic gates (TTL).Diode Circuits 121A more familiar example of a sensitive circuit is a moving-coil meter. By 
including a limiter, we can protect the meter movement against excessive input 
voltage or current. 
The limiter of Fig. 4-26 a is also called a diode clamp.  The term suggests 
clamping or limiting the voltage to a specifi  ed range. With a diode clamp, the 
diodes remain off during normal operation. The diodes conduct only when some-
thing is abnormal, when the signal is too large.
Biased Clippers
The reference level (same as the clipping level) of a positive clipper is ideally zero, 
or 0.7 V to a second approximation. What can we do to change this reference level?
In electronics, bias means applying an external voltage to change the 
reference level of a circuit. Figure 4-27 a is an example of using bias to change 
the reference level of a positive clipper. By adding a dc voltage source in series 
with the diode, we can change the clipping level. The new V must be less than Vp
for normal operation. With an ideal diode, conduction starts as soon as the input vin vout

age is greater than V 1 0.7 V .
Figure 4-27 b shows how to bias a negative clipper. Notice that the diode 
and battery have been reversed. Because of this, the reference level changes to 
2V 2 0.7 V . The output waveform is negatively clipped at the bias level.
Combination Clipper
We can combine the two biased clippers as shown in Fig. 4-28. Diode D1 
clips off positive parts above the positive bias level, and diode D2 clips off 
parts below the negative bias level. When the input voltage is very large 
 compared to the bias levels, the output signal is a square wave,  as shown in 
Fig. 4-28. This is another example of the signal shaping that is possible with 
clippers.
Variations
Using batteries to set the clipping level is impractical. One approach is to add 
more silicon diodes because each produces a bias of 0.7 V . For instance, Fig. 4-29 a 
shows three diodes in a positive clipper. Since each diode has an offset of around 
0.7 V , the three diodes produce a clipping level of approximately 12.1 V . The 
 application does not have to be a clipper (waveshaping). We can use the same 
circuit as a diode clamp (limiting) to protect a sensitive circuit that cannot tolerate 
more than a 2.1-V input.
Figure 4-29 b shows another way to bias a clipper without batteries. This 
time, we are using a voltage divider ( R1 and R2) to set the bias level. The bias level 
is given by:
Vbias 5   R2 _______ R1 1 R2   Vdc (4-18)
In this case, the output voltage is clipped or limited when the input is greater than 
Vbias 1 0.7 V .
Figure 4-29 c shows a biased diode clamp. It can be used to protect sen-
sitive circuits from excessive input voltages. The bias level is shown as 15 V . It 
can be any bias level you want it to be. With a circuit like this, a destructively 
large voltage of 1100 V never reaches the load because the diode limits the output 
voltage to a maximum value of 15.7 V .
Sometimes a variation like Fig. 4-29 d is used to remove the offset of 
the limiting diode D1. Here is the idea: Diode D2 is biased slightly into forward 
conduction so that it has approximately 0.7 V across it. This 0.7 V is applied to 
1 kV in series with D1 and 100 k V. This means that diode D1 is on the verge of 
conduction. Therefore, when a signal comes in, diode D1 conducts near 0 V .1V+ 0.7

The diode clamp, which was discussed in the preceding section, protects sensitive 
circuits. The clamper  is different, so don’t confuse the similar-sounding names. 
A clamper adds a dc voltage to the signal.
Positive Clamper
Figure 4-30 a shows the basic idea for a positive clamper. When a positive clamper 
has a sine-wave input, it adds a positive dc voltage to the sine wave. Stated another 
way, the positive clamper shifts the ac reference level (normally zero) up to a dc level. 
The effect is to have an ac voltage centered on a dc level. This means that each point 
on the sine wave is shifted upward, as shown on the output wave.
Figure 4-30 b shows an equivalent way of visualizing the effect of a pos-
itive clamper. An ac source drives the input side of the clamper. The Thevenin 
voltage of the clamper output is the superposition of a dc source and an ac source. 
The ac signal has a dc voltage of Vp added to it. This is why the entire sine wave of 
Fig. 4-30 a has shifted upward so that it has a positive peak of 2 Vp and a negative 
peak of zero.
Figure 4-31 a is a positive clamper. Ideally, here is how it works. The 
capacitor is initially uncharged. On the fi  rst negative half-cycle of input voltage, 
the diode turns on (Fig. 4-31 b). At the negative peak of the ac source, the capacitor 
has fully charged and its voltage is Vp with the polarity shown.
Slightly beyond the negative peak, the diode shuts off (Fig. 4-31 c). The 
RLC time constant is deliberately made much larger than the period T of the sig-
nal. We will defi  ne much larger  as at least 100 times greater:
Stiff clamper: RLC /H11022 100T (4-19)
For this reason, the capacitor remains almost fully charged during the off time of 
the diode. To a fi  rst approximation, the capacitor acts like a battery of Vp volts. 
This is why the output voltage in Fig. 4-31 a is a positively clamped signal. Any 
clamper that satisfi  es Eq. (4-19) is called a stiff clamper.GOOD TO KNOW
Clampers are commonly used in 
IC application circuits to shift the 
dc level of a signal in a positive 
or negative direction.

adds a dc component to signal.124 Chapter 4The idea is similar to the way a half-wave rectifi  er with a capacitor-input 
fi lter works. The fi  rst quarter-cycle charges the capacitor fully. Then, the capacitor 
retains almost all of its charge during subsequent cycles. The small charge that is 
lost between cycles is replaced by diode conduction.
In Fig. 4-31 c, the charged capacitor looks like a battery with a voltage of 
Vp. This is the dc voltage that is being added to the signal. After the fi  rst quarter- 
cycle, the output voltage is a positively clamped sine wave with a reference level 
of zero; that is, it sits on a level of 0 V .
Figure 4-31 d shows the circuit as it is usually drawn. Since the diode 
drops 0.7 V when conducting, the capacitor voltage does not quite reach Vp. For 
this reason, the clamping is not perfect, and the negative peaks have a reference 
level of 20.7 V .
Negative Clamper
What happens if we turn the diode in Fig. 4-31 d around? We get the negative 
clamper of Fig. 4-32. As you can see, the capacitor voltage reverses, and the cir-
cuit becomes a negative clamper. Again, the clamping is less than perfect because 
the positive peaks have a reference level of 0.7 V instead of 0 V .
As a memory aid, notice that the diode points in the direction of shift. In 
Fig. 4-32, the diode points downward, the same direction as the shift of the sine 
wave. This tells you that it’s a negative clamper. In Fig. 4-31 a, the diode points up, 
the waveform shifts up, and you have positive clamper.(a)( b)+Vp+Vp

Clampers are also used in radar and communication circuits.
A fi  nal point. The less-than-perfect clipping and clamping discussed 
so far are no problem. After we discuss op amps, we will look again at clip-
pers and clampers. At that time, you will see how easy it is to eliminate the 
barrier- potential problem. In other words, we will look at circuits that are almost 
perfect.
Peak-to-Peak Detector
A half-wave rectifi  er with a capacitor-input fi  lter produces a dc output voltage 
approximately equal to the peak of the input signal. When the same circuit uses a 
small-signal diode, it is called a peak detector.  Typically, peak detectors operate 
at frequencies that are much higher than 60 Hz. The output of a peak detector is 
useful in measurements, signal processing, and communications.
If you cascade a clamper and a peak detector, you get a peak-to-peak 
 detector  (see Fig. 4-33). As you can see, the output of a clamper is used as the 
input to a peak detector. Since the sine wave is positively clamped, the input to the 
peak detector has a peak value of 2 Vp. This is why the output of the peak detector 
is a dc voltage equal to 2 Vp.
As usual, the RC time constant must be much greater than the period of 
the signal. By satisfying this condition, you get good clamping action and good 
peak detection. The output ripple will therefore be small.
One application is in measuring nonsinusoidal signals. An ordinary ac 
voltmeter is calibrated to read the rms value of an ac signal. If you try to measure 
a nonsinusoidal signal, you will get an incorrect reading with an ordinary ac volt-
meter. However, if the output of a peak-to-peak detector is used as the input to a 
dc voltmeter, it will indicate the peak-to-peak voltage. If the nonsinusoidal signal 
swings from 220 to 1 50 V , the reading is 70 V .
4-12  Voltage Multipliers
A peak-to-peak detector uses small-signal diodes and operates at high frequen-
cies. By using rectifi  er diodes and operating at 60 Hz, we can produce a new kind 
of power supply called a voltage doubler.≈+2Vp

Figure 4-34 a is a voltage doubler.  The confi  guration is the same as a peak-to-peak 
detector, except that we use rectifi  er diodes and operate at 60 Hz. The clamper 
section adds a dc component to the secondary voltage. The peak detector then 
produces a dc output voltage that is two times the secondary voltage.
Why bother using a voltage doubler when you can change the turns ratio 
to get more output voltage? The answer is that you don’t need to use a voltage 
doubler at lower voltages. The only time you run into a problem is when you are 
trying to produce very high dc output voltages.
For instance, line voltage is 120 V rms, or 170 V peak. If you are trying 
to produce 3400 V dc, you will need to use a 1 ;20 step-up transformer. Here is 
where the problem comes in. Very high secondary voltages can be obtained only 
with bulky transformers. At some point, a designer may decide that it would be 
simpler to use a voltage doubler and a smaller transformer.C1 D2

QUADRUPLER OUTPUTFigure 4-34  Voltage multipliers with ﬂ  oating loads. ( a) Doubler; ( b) tripler; 
(c) quadrupler.Diode Circuits 127Voltage Tripler
By connecting another section, we get the voltage tripler  of Fig. 4-34 b. The 
fi rst two sections act like a doubler. At the peak of the negative half-cycle, D3
is  forward biased. This charges C3 to 2Vp with the polarity shown in Fig. 4-34 b. 
The tripler output appears across C1 and C3. The load resistance can be connected 
across the tripler output. As long as the time constant is long, the output equals 
 approximately 3 Vp.
Voltage Quadrupler
Figure 4-34 c is a voltage quadrupler  with four sections in cascade  (one after 
another). The fi  rst three sections are a tripler, and the fourth makes the overall cir-
cuit a quadrupler. The fi  rst capacitor charges to Vp. All others charge to 2 Vp. The 
quadrupler output is across the series connection of C2 and C4. We can connect a 
load resistance across the quadrupler output to get an output of 4 Vp.
Theoretically, we can add sections indefi  nitely, but the ripple gets much 
worse with each new section. Increased ripple is another reason why voltage 
multipliers (doublers, triplers, and quadruplers) are not used in low-voltage 
power supplies. As stated earlier, voltage multipliers are almost always used 
to produce high voltages, well into the hundreds or thousands of volts. V oltage 
 multipliers are the natural choice for high-voltage and low-current devices like 
the cathode-ray tube (CRT) used in television receivers, oscilloscopes, and com-
puter monitors.
Variations
All of the voltage multipliers shown in Fig. 4-34 use load resistances that are 
fl  oating.  This means that neither end of the load is grounded. Figures 4-35 a,
b, and c show variations of the voltage multipliers. Figure 4-35 a merely adds 
grounds to Fig. 4-34 a. On the other hand, Figs. 4-35 b and c are redesigns of the 
tripler (Fig. 4-34 b) and quadrupler (Fig. 4-34 c). In some applications, you may 
see  fl  oating-load designs used (such as in the CRT); in others, you may see the 
grounded-load designs used.
Full-Wave Voltage Doubler
Figure 4-35 d shows a full-wave voltage doubler. On the positive half-cycle of 
the source, the upper capacitor charges to the peak voltage with the polarity 
shown. On the next half-cycle, the lower capacitor charges to the peak voltage 
with the indicated polarity. For a light load, the fi  nal output voltage is approx-
imately 2 Vp.
The voltage multipliers discussed earlier are half-wave designs; that is, 
the output ripple frequency is 60 Hz. On the other hand, the circuit of Fig. 4-35 d
is called a full-wave voltage doubler  because one of the output capacitors is being 
charged during each half-cycle. Because of this, the output ripple is 120 Hz. This 
ripple frequency is an advantage because it is easier to fi  lter. Another advantage 
of the full-wave doubler is that the PIV rating of the diodes need only be greater 
than  Vp.128 Chapter 4
Summary
SEC. 4-1   THE HALF-WAVE 
RECTIFIER
The half-wave rectiﬁ  er has a diode 
in series with a load resistor. The 
load voltage is a half-wave output. 
The average or dc voltage out of a half-wave rectiﬁ  er equals 31.8 per-
cent of the peak voltage.
SEC. 4-2  THE TRANSFORMER
The input transformer is usually a 
step-down transformer in which the voltage steps down and the current 
steps up. The secondary voltage 
equals the primary voltage divided 
by the turns ratio.Vp

RECTIFIER
The full-wave rectiﬁ  er has a center-
tapped transformer with two diodes 
and a load resistor. The load voltage 
is a full-wave signal whose peak 
value is half the secondary voltage. 
The average or dc voltage out of a 
full-wave rectiﬁ  er equals 63.6 per-
cent of the peak voltage, and the 
 ripple frequency equals 120 Hz 
instead of 60 Hz.
SEC. 4-4  THE BRIDGE 
RECTIFIER
The bridge rectiﬁ  er has four diodes. 
The load voltage is a full-wave signal 
with a peak value equal to the sec-
ondary voltage. The average or dc 
voltage out of a half-wave rectiﬁ  er 
equals 63.6 percent of the peak volt-
age, and the ripple frequency equals 
120 Hz.
SEC. 4-5   THE CHOKE-INPUT 
FILTER
The choke-input ﬁ  lter is an LC volt-
age divider in which the inductive 
reactance is much greater than the 
capacitive reactance. The type of 
ﬁ  lter allows the average value of the 
rectiﬁ  ed signal to pass through to the 
load resistor.
SEC. 4-6   THE CAPACITOR-
INPUT FILTER
This type of ﬁ  lter allows the peak 
value of the rectiﬁ  ed signal to pass 
through to the load resistor. With a large capacitor, the ripple is small, 
typically less than 10 per cent of 
the dc voltage. The capacitor-input 
 ﬁ  lter is the most widely used ﬁ  lter in 
power supplies.
SEC. 4-7   PEAK INVERSE 
 VOLTAGE AND SURGE 
CURRENT
The peak inverse voltage is the 
 maximum voltage that appears 
across the nonconducting diode of 
a rectiﬁ  er circuit. This voltage must 
be less than the breakdown voltage 
of the diode. The surge current is 
the brief and large current that exists 
when the power is ﬁ  rst turned on. 
It is brief and large because the ﬁ  lter 
 capacitor must charge to the peak 
voltage during the ﬁ  rst cycle or, at 
most, during the ﬁ  rst few cycles.
SEC. 4-8   OTHER POWER- 
SUPPLY TOPICS
Real transformers usually specify the 
secondary voltage at a rated load 
current. To calculate the  primary 
 current, you can assume that the 
input power equals the output 
power. Slow-blow fuses are typically 
used to protect against the surge 
 current. The average diode current 
in a half-wave rectiﬁ  er equals the 
dc load  current. In a full-wave or 
bridge  rectiﬁ  er, the average  current 
in any diode is half the dc load 
 current. RC ﬁ  lters and LC ﬁ  lters may 
occasionally be used to ﬁ  lter the 
 rectiﬁ  ed output.SEC. 4-9  TROUBLESHOOTING
Some of the measurements that can 
be made with a capacitor-input ﬁ  lter 
are the dc output voltage, the pri-
mary voltage, the secondary voltage, 
and the ripple. From these, you can 
usually deduce the trouble. Open 
diodes reduce the output voltage 
to zero. An open ﬁ  lter capacitor 
reduces the output to the average 
value of the rectiﬁ  ed signal.
SEC. 4-10   CLIPPERS AND 
LIMITERS
A clipper shapes the signal. It clips 
off  positive or negative parts of the 
signal. The limiter or diode clamp 
protects sensitive circuits from too 
much input.
SEC. 4-11  CLAMPERS
The clamper shifts a signal positively 
or negatively by adding a dc voltage 
to the signal. The peak-to-peak de-
tector produces a load voltage equal 
to the peak-to-peak value.
SEC. 4-12   VOLTAGE 
MULTIPLIERS
The voltage doubler is a redesign 
of the peak-to-peak detector. It uses 
rectiﬁ  er diodes instead of small-
signal diodes. It produces an output 
equal to two times the peak value of 
the rectiﬁ  ed signal. Voltage triplers 
and quadruplers multiply the input 
peak by factors of 3 and 4. Very high 
voltage power supplies are the main 
use of voltage multipliers.

Rectiﬁ  er diodes are the most common type of diode. They are 
used in power supplies to convert ac voltage to dc voltage. But 
rectiﬁ  cation is not all that a diode can do. Now we will discuss 
diodes used in other applications. The chapter begins with the 
zener diode, which is optimized for its breakdown properties. 
Zener diodes are very important because they are the key to 
voltage regulation. The chapter also covers optoelectronic 
diodes, including light-emitting diodes (LEDs), Schottky diodes, 
varactors, and other diodes.

Small-signal and rectifi  er diodes are never intentionally operated in the breakdown 
region because this may damage them. A zener diode  is different; it is a silicon 
diode that the manufacturer has optimized for operation in the breakdown region. 
The zener diode is the backbone of voltage regulators, circuits that hold the load 
voltage almost constant despite large changes in line voltage and load resistance.
I-V Graph
Figure 5-1 a shows the schematic symbol of a zener diode; Fig. 5-1 b is an alterna-
tive symbol. In either symbol, the lines resemble a z, which stands for “zener.” 
By varying the doping level of silicon diodes, a manufacturer can produce zener 
diodes with breakdown voltages from about 2 to over 1000 V . These diodes can 
operate in any of three regions: forward, leakage, and breakdown.
Figure 5-1 c shows the I-V graph of a zener diode. In the forward region, 
it starts conducting around 0.7 V , just like an ordinary silicon diode. In the leak-
age region  (between zero and breakdown), it has only a small reverse current. In a 
zener diode, the breakdown has a very sharp knee, followed by an almost vertical 
increase in current. Note that the voltage is almost constant, approximately equal 
to VZ over most of the breakdown region. Data sheets usually specify the value of 
VZ at a particular test current IZT.
Figure 5-1 c also shows the maximum reverse current IZM. As long as 
the reverse current is less than IZM, the diode is operating within its safe range. If 
the current is greater than IZM, the diode will be destroyed. To prevent excessive 
 reverse current, a current-limiting resistor  must be used (discussed later).
Zener Resistance
In the third approximation of a silicon diode, the forward voltage across a diode 
equals the knee voltage plus the additional voltage across the bulk resistance.

As with conventional diodes, the 
manufacturer places a band on 
the cathode end of the zener 
diode for terminal identification.Special-Purpose Diodes  143Similarly, in the breakdown region, the reverse voltage across a diode 
equals the breakdown voltage plus the additional voltage across the bulk resis-
tance. In the reverse region, the bulk resistance is referred to as the zener resis-
tance . This resistance equals the inverse of the slope in the breakdown region. 
In other words, the more vertical the breakdown region, the smaller the zener 
 resistance.
In Fig. 5-1 c, the zener resistance means that an increase in reverse cur-
rent produces a slight increase in reverse voltage. The increase in voltage is very 
small, typically only a few tenths of a volt. This slight increase may be impor-
tant in design work, but not in troubleshooting and preliminary analysis. Unless 
 otherwise indicated, our discussions will ignore the zener resistance. Figure 5-1 d
shows typical zener diodes.
Zener Regulator
A zener diode is sometimes called a voltage-regulator diode  because it maintains 
a constant output voltage even though the current through it changes. For normal 
operation, you have to reverse-bias the zener diode, as shown in Fig. 5-2 a. Fur-
thermore, to get breakdown operation, the source voltage VS must be greater than 
the zener breakdown voltage VZ. A series resistor RS is always used to limit the 
zener current to less than its maximum current rating. Otherwise, the zener diode 
will burn out, like any device with too much power dissipation.
Figure 5-2 b shows an alternative way to draw the circuit with grounds. 
Whenever a circuit has grounds, you can measure voltages with respect to ground.
For instance, suppose you want to know the voltage across the series 
 resistor of Fig. 5-2 b. Here is the one way to fi  nd it when you have a built-up cir-
cuit. First, measure the voltage from the left end of RS to ground. Second, measure 
the voltage from the right end of RS to ground. Third, subtract the two voltages to 
get the voltage across RS. If you have a fl  oating VOM or DMM, you can connect 
 directly across the series resistor.
Figure 5-2 c shows the output of a power supply connected to a series 
 resistor and a zener diode. This circuit is used when you want a dc output voltage 
that is less than the output of the power supply. A circuit like this is called a zener 
voltage regulator,  or simply a zener regulator.
Ohm’s Law Again
In Fig. 5-2, the voltage across the series or current-limiting resistor equals the dif-
ference between the source voltage and the zener voltage. Therefore, the current 
through the resistor is:

rent. This is because Fig. 5-2 is a series circuit. Note that IS must be less than IZM.
Ideal Zener Diode
For troubleshooting and preliminary analysis, we can approximate the break-
down region as vertical. Therefore, the voltage is constant even though the current 
changes, which is equivalent to ignoring the zener resistance. Figure 5-3 shows 
the ideal approximation of a zener diode. This means that a zener diode operating 
in the breakdown region ideally acts like a battery. In a circuit, it means that you 
can mentally replace a zener diode by a voltage source of VZ, provided the zener 
diode is operating in the breakdown region.= VZ
–+Figure 5-3  Ideal approximation of 
a zener diode.
Example 5-1
Suppose the zener diode of Fig. 5-4 a has a breakdown voltage of 10 V . What are 
the minimum and maximum zener currents?
SOLUTION  The applied voltage may vary from 20 to 40 V . Ideally, a zener 
diode acts like the battery shown in Fig. 5-4 b. Therefore, the output voltage is 
10 V for any source voltage between 20 and 40 V .
The minimum current occurs when the source voltage is minimum. 
 Visualize 20 V on the left end of the resistor and 10 V on the right end. Then you 
can see that the voltage across the resistor is 20 V 2 10 V , or 10 V . The rest is 
Ohm’s law:
IS 5   10 V ______ 820 V   5 12.2 mA
The maximum current occurs when the source voltage is 40 V . In this case, the 
 voltage across the resistor is 30 V , which gives a current of
IS 5   30 V ______ 820 V   5 36.6 mA
In a voltage regulator like Fig. 5-4 a, the output voltage is held constant at 
10 V , despite the change in source voltage from 20 to 40 V . The larger source volt-
age produces more zener current, but the output voltage holds rock-solid at 10 V . 
(If the zener resistance is included, the output voltage increases slightly when the 
source voltage increases.)

Figure 5-5 a shows a loaded  zener regulator, and Fig. 5-5 b shows the same circuit 
with grounds. The zener diode operates in the breakdown region and holds the 
load voltage constant. Even if the source voltage changes or the load resistance 
varies, the load voltage will remain fi  xed and equal to the zener voltage.
Breakdown Operation
How can you tell whether the zener diode of Fig. 5-5 is operating in the breakdown 
region? Because of the voltage divider, the Thevenin voltage facing the diode is:
VTH5RL ________
RS 1 RL VS (5-2)
This is the voltage that exists when the zener diode is disconnected from the cir-
cuit. This Thevenin voltage has to be greater than the zener voltage; otherwise, 
breakdown cannot occur.
Series Current
Unless otherwise indicated, in all subsequent discussions we assume that the 
zener diode is operating in the breakdown region. In Fig. 5-5, the current through 
the series resistor is given by:
IS5VS – V Z _______
RS(5-3)
This is Ohm’s law applied to the current-limiting resistor. It is the same whether 
or not there is a load resistor. In other words, if you disconnect the load resistor, 
the current through the series resistor still equals the voltage across the resistor 
 divided by the resistance.
Load Current
Ideally, the load voltage equals the zener voltage because the load resistor is in 
parallel with the zener diode. As an equation:

This allows us to use Ohm’s law to calculate the load current:

With Kirchhoff’s current law:
IS 5 IZ 1 IL
The zener diode and the load resistor are in parallel. The sum of their currents 
has to equal the total current, which is the same as the current through the series 
resistor.
We can rearrange the foregoing equation to get this important formula:
IZ 5 IS 2 IL (5-6)
This tells you that the zener current no longer equals the series current, as it does 
in an unloaded zener regulator. Because of the load resistor, the zener current now 
equals the series current minus the load current.
Summary Table 5-1 summarizes the steps in the analysis of a loaded 
zener regulator. You start with the series current, followed by the load voltage and 
load current, and fi  nally the zener current.
Zener Eff  ect
When the breakdown voltage is greater than 6 V , the cause of the breakdown is the 
avalanche effect, discussed in Chap. 2. The basic idea is that minority carriers are 
accelerated to high enough speeds to dislodge other minority carriers, producing 
a chain or avalanche effect that results in a large reverse current.
The zener effect is different. When a diode is heavily doped, the deple-
tion layer becomes very narrow. Because of this, the electric fi  eld across the de-
pletion layer (voltage divided by distance) is very intense. When the fi  eld strength 
reaches approximately 300,000 V/cm, the fi  eld is intense enough to pull electrons 
out of their valence orbits. The creation of free electrons in this way is called the 
zener effect  (also known as high-fi  eld emission ). This is distinctly different from 
the avalanche effect, which depends on high-speed minority carriers dislodging 
valence electrons.
When the breakdown voltage is less than 4 V , only the zener effect oc-
curs. When the breakdown voltage is greater than 6 V , only the avalanche effect 
occurs. When the breakdown voltage is between 4 and 6 V , both effects are 
present.
The zener effect was discovered before the avalanche effect, so all diodes 
used in the breakdown region came to be known as zener diodes. Although you 
may occasionally hear the term avalanche diode,  the name zener diode  is in gen-
eral use for all breakdown diodes.
GOOD TO KNOW
For zener voltages between 
approximately 3 and 8 V, the 
temperature coefficient is 
also strongly affected by the 
reverse current in the diode. 
The temperature coefficient 
becomes more positive as 
current increases.Summary Table 5-1Analyzing a Loaded

When the ambient temperature changes, the zener voltage will change slightly. On 
data sheets, the effect of temperature is listed under the temperature coeffi  cient,
which is defi  ned as the change in breakdown voltage per degree of increase. The 
temperature coeffi  cient is negative for breakdown voltages less than 4 V (zener 
 effect). For instance, a zener diode with a breakdown voltage of 3.9 V may have a 
temperature coeffi  cient of 21.4 mV/°C. If temperature increases by 1°, the break-
down voltage decreases by 1.4 mV .
On the other hand, the temperature coeffi  cient is positive for breakdown 
voltages greater than 6 V (avalanche effect). For instance, a zener diode with a 
breakdown voltage of 6.2 V may have a temperature coeffi  cient of 2 mV/°C. If the 
temperature increases by 1°, the breakdown voltage increases by 2 mV .
Between 4 and 6 V , the temperature coeffi  cient changes from negative to 
positive. In other words, there are zener diodes with breakdown voltages between 
4 and 6 V in which the temperature coeffi  cient equals zero.  This is important in 
some applications when a solid zener voltage is needed over a large temperature 
range.GOOD TO KNOW
In applications requiring a 
highly stable reference voltage, 
a zener diode is connected in 
series with one or more semi-
conductor diodes whose voltage 
drops change with temperature 
in the opposite direction that VZ
changes. The result is that VZ
remains very  stable even though 
the temperature may vary over a 
wide range.148 Chapter 5
Application Example 5-4
What does the circuit of Fig. 5-7 do?
SOLUTION   This is an example of a preregulator  (the fi  rst zener diode) driving a zener regulator (the second zener 
diode). First, notice that the preregulator has an output voltage of 20 V . This is the input to the second zener regulator, who se 
output is 10 V . The basic idea is to provide the second regulator with a well-regulated input so that the fi  nal output is ex-
tremely well regulated.
Application Example 5-5
What does the circuit of Fig. 5-8 do?
SOLUTION   In most applications, zener diodes are used in voltage regulators where they remain in the breakdown re-
gion. But there are exceptions. Sometimes, zener diodes are used in waveshaping circuits like Fig. 5-8.
Notice the back-to-back connection of two zener diodes. On the positive half-cycle, the upper diode conducts 
and the lower diode breaks down. Therefore, the output is clipped as shown. The clipping level equals the zener voltage 
 (broken-down diode) plus 0.7 V (forward-biased diode).
On the negative half-cycle, the action is reversed. The lower diode conducts, and the upper diode breaks down. In 
this way, the output is almost a square wave. The larger the input sine wave, the better looking the output square wave.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 5-5   In Fig. 5-8, the VZ for each diode is 3.3 V . What would the voltage across RL be?
Since the load voltage is 10 V , the load current is:

Briefl  y describe the circuit action for each of the circuits in Fig. 5-9.
SOLUTION   Figure 5-9 a shows how zener diodes and ordinary silicon diodes can produce several dc output voltages, 
given a 20-V power supply. The bottom diode produces an output of 10 V . Each silicon diode is forward biased, producing 
outputs of 10.7 V and 11.4 V , as shown. The top diode has a breakdown voltage of 2.4 V , giving an output of 13.8 V . With 
other combinations of zener and silicon diodes, a circuit like this can produce different dc output voltages.
If you try to connect a 6-V relay to a 12-V system, you will probably damage the relay. It is necessary to drop some 
of the voltage. Figure 5-9 b shows one way to do this. By connecting a 5.6-V zener diode in series with the relay, only 6.4 V 
appears across the relay, which is usually within the tolerance of the relay’s voltage rating.
Large electrolytic capacitors often have small voltage ratings. For instance, an electrolytic capacitor of 1000 /H9262F 
may have a voltage rating of only 6 V . This means that the maximum voltage across the capacitor should be less than 6 V . 
Figure 5-9 c shows a workaround solution in which a 6-V electrolytic capacitor is used with a 12-V power supply. Again, the 
idea is to use a zener diode to drop some of the voltage. In this case, the zener diode drops 6.8 V , leaving only 5.2 V across 
the capacitor. This way, the electrolytic capacitor can fi  lter the power supply and still remain with its voltage rating.(a)

of a Zener Diode
Figure 5-10 a shows the second approximation of a zener diode. A zener resistance 
is in series with an ideal battery. The total voltage across the zener diode equals 
the breakdown voltage plus the voltage drop across the zener resistance. Since RZ
is relatively small in a zener diode, it has only a minor effect on the total voltage 
across the zener diode.
Eff  ect on Load Voltage
How can we calculate the effect of the zener resistance on the load voltage? 
Figure 5-10 b shows a power supply driving a loaded zener regulator. Ideally, the 
load voltage equals the breakdown voltage VZ. But in the second approximation, 
we include the zener resistance as shown in Fig. 5-10 c. The additional voltage 
drop across RZ will slightly increase the load voltage.
Since the zener current fl  ows through the zener resistance in Fig. 5-10 c, 
the load voltage is given by:
VL 5 VZ 1 IZRZ
As you can see, the change in the load voltage from the ideal case is:
DVL5IZRZ (5-7)
Usually, RZ is small, so the voltage change is small, typically in tenths of a volt. 
For instance, if IZ 5 10 mA and RZ 5 10 V, then DVL 5 0.1 V .

Eff  ect on Ripple
As far as ripple is concerned, we can use the equivalent circuit shown in 
Fig. 5-11 a. In other words, the only components that affect the ripple are the three 
resistances shown. We can simplify this even further. In a typical design, RZ is 
much smaller than RL. Therefore, the only two components that have a signifi  cant 
effect on ripple are the series resistance and zener resistance shown in Fig. 5-11 b.
Since Fig. 5-11 b is a voltage divider, we can write the following equation 
for the output ripple:
VR(out) 5   RZ _______ RS 1 RZ   VR(in)
Ripple calculations are not critical; that is, they don’t have to be exact. Since RS
is always much greater than RZ in a typical design, we can use this approximation

The zener regulator of Fig. 5-13 has VZ 5 10 V , RS 5 270 V, and RZ 5 8.5 V, the same values used in Examples 5-7 and 
5-8. Describe the measurements being made in this Multisim circuit analysis.Special-Purpose Diodes  153
SOLUTION   If we calculate the voltages in Fig. 5-13 using the methods discussed earlier, we will get the following 
 results. With an 8:1 transformer, the peak secondary voltage is 21.2 V . Subtract two diode drops, and you get a peak of 19.8 V
across the fi  lter capacitor. The current through the 390- V resistor is 51 mA, and the current through RS is 36 mA. The capaci-
tor has to supply the sum of these two currents, which is 87 mA. With Eq. (4-10), this current results in a ripple across the 
capacitor of approximately 2.7 V p-p. With this, we can  calculate the ripple out of the zener regulator, which is approximately 
85 mV p-p.
Since the ripple is large, the voltage across the capacitor swings from a high of 19.8 V to a low of 17.1 V . If you av-
erage these two values, you get 18.5 V as the approximate dc voltage across the fi  lter capacitor. This lower dc voltage means 
that the input and output ripple calculated earlier will also be lower. As discussed in the preceding chapter, calculations lik e 
these are only  estimates because the exact analysis has to include higher-order effects.
Now, let us look at the Multisim measurements, which are almost exact answers. The multimeter reads 18.52 V , 
very close to the estimated value of 18.5 V . Channel 1 of the oscilloscope shows the ripple across the capacitor. It is approxi -
mately 2.8 V p-p, very close to the estimated 2.7 V p-p. And fi  nally, the output ripple of the zener regulator is  approximately 
85 mV p-p (channel 2).
Figure 5-13  (continued)154 Chapter 55-4 Zener Drop-Out Point
For a zener regulator to hold the output voltage constant, the zener diode must 
 remain in the breakdown region under all operating conditions. This is equivalent 
to saying that there must be zener current for all source voltages and load currents.
Worst-Case Conditions
Figure 5-14 a shows a zener regulator. It has the following currents:
IS 5VS 2 VZ _______
RS520 V 2 10 V ___________
200 V5 50 mA
IL 5   VL___
RL510 V_____
1 kV5 10 mA
and
IZ 5 IS 2 IL 5 50 mA  2 10 mA  5 40 mA
Now, consider what happens when the source voltage decreases from 
20 to 12 V . In the foregoing calculations, you can see that IS will decrease, IL will 
remain the same, and IZ will decrease. When VS equals 12 V , IS will equal 10 mA, 
and IZ5 0. At this low source voltage, the zener diode is about to come out of the 
breakdown region. If the source decreases any further, regulation will be lost. In 
other words, the load voltage will become less than 10 V . Therefore, a low source 
voltage can cause the zener circuit to fail to regulate.
Another way to get a loss of regulation is by having too much load cur-
rent. In Fig. 5-14 a, consider what happens when the load resistance decreases 
from 1 k V to 200 V. When the load resistance is 200 V, the load current increases 
to 50 mA, which is equal to the current through RS, and the zener current decreases 
to zero. Again, the zener diode is about to come out of breakdown. Therefore, a 
zener circuit will fail to regulate if the load resistance is too low.
Finally, consider what happens when RS increases from 200 V to 1 k V. 
In this case, the series current decreases from 50 to 10 mA. Therefore, a high 
 series resistance can bring the circuit out of regulation.

conditions. When the zener current is near zero, the zener regulation is approach-
ing a drop-out or failure condition. By analyzing the circuit for these worst-case 
conditions, it is possible to derive the following equation:
RS(max) 5  (   VS(min) ______  VZ   2 1 )  RL(min) (5-9)
An alternative form of this equation is also useful:
RS(max) 5   VS(min) 2 VZ ___________  IL(max)   (5-10)
These two equations are useful because you can check a zener regulator to see 
whether it will fail under any operating conditions.
Example 5-10
A zener regulator has an input voltage that may vary from 22 to 30 V . If the regu-
lated output voltage is 12 V and the load resistance varies from 140 V to 10 k V, 
what is the maximum allowable series resistance?
SOLUTION  Use Eq. (5-9) to calculate the maximum series resistance as 
 follows:
RS(max) 5  (   22 V _____ 12 V   2 1 )  140 V 5 117 V
As long as the series resistance is less than 117 V, the zener regulator will work 
properly under all operating conditions.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 5-10   Using Example 5-10, what is the maximum 
allowable series resistance if the regulated output voltage is 15 V?
Example 5-11
A zener regulator has an input voltage ranging from 15 to 20 V and a load  current 
ranging from 5 to 20 mA. If the zener voltage is 6.8 V , what is the  maximum 
allowable series resistance?
SOLUTION  Use Eq. (5-10) to calculate the maximum series resistance as 
 follows:
RS(max) 5   15 V 2 6.8 V  ____________  20 mA   5 410 V
If the series resistance is less than 410 V, the zener regulator will work properly 
under all conditions.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 5-11   Repeat Example 5-11 using a zener voltage 
of 5.1 V .156 Chapter 55-5 Reading a Data Sheet
Figure 5-15 shows the data sheets for the 1N5221B and 1N4728A series of zener 
diodes. Refer to these data sheets during the following discussion. Again, most of 
the information on a data sheet is for designers, but there are a few items that even 
troubleshooters and testers will want to know about.
Maximum Power
The power dissipation of a zener diode equals the product of its voltage and 
 current:
PZ5VZIZ (5-11)
For instance, if VZ 5 12 V and IZ 5 10 mA, then
PZ5 (12 V)(10 mA) 5 120 mW
As long as PZ is less than the power rating, the zener diode can operate in the 
breakdown region without being destroyed. Commercially available zener diodes 
have power ratings from ¼    to more than 50 W.
For example, the data sheet for the 1N5221B series lists a maximum 
power rating of 500 mW. A safe design includes a safety factor to keep the power 
dissipation well below this 500-mW maximum. As mentioned elsewhere, safety 
factors of 2 or more are used for conservative designs.
Maximum Current
Data sheets often include the maximum current IZM a zener diode can handle with-
out exceeding its power rating. If this value is not listed, the maximum current can 
be found as follows:
IZM5PZM____
VZ(5-12)
where IZM 5 maximum rated zener current
PZM5 power rating
VZ 5 zener voltage
For example, the 1N4742A has a zener voltage of 12 V and a 1 W power rating. 
Therefore, it has a maximum current rating of
IZM51 W}12 V5 83.3 mA
If you satisfy the current rating, you automatically satisfy the power rat-
ing. For instance, if you keep the maximum zener current less than 83.3 mA, you 
are also keeping the maximum power dissipation to less than 1 W. If you throw in 
the safety factor of 2, you don’t have to worry about a marginal design blowing 
the diode. The IZM value, either listed or calculated, is a continuous current rating. 
Nonrepetitive peak reverse current values are often given, which include notes on 
how this device was tested.
Tolerance
Most zener diodes will have a suffi  x A, B, C, or D to identify the zener voltage 
tolerance. Because these suffi  x markings are not always consistent, be sure to 
identify any special notes included on the zener’s data sheet that indicate that 
specifi  c tolerance. For instance, the data sheet for the 1N4728A series shows its 
tolerance to equal 65 percent, while the 1N5221B series also has a tolerance of 
65 percent. A suffi  x of C generally indicates 62 percent, D 61 percent, and no 
suffi x 620 percent.Special-Purpose Diodes  157
Figure 5-15( a)  Zener “Partial” data sheets. (Copyright of Fairchild Semiconductor. Used by Permission.)158 Chapter 5
Figure 5-15( b)  (continued)Special-Purpose Diodes  159Zener Resistance
The zener resistance (also called zener impedance ) may be designated RZT or ZZT. 
For instance, the 1N5237B has a zener resistance of 8.0 V measured at a test 
current of 20.0 mA. As long as the zener current is beyond the knee of the curve, 
you can use 8.0 V as the approximate value of the zener resistance. But note how 
the zener resistance increases at the knee of the curve (1000 V). The point is this: 
 Operation should be at or near the test current, if at all possible. Then you know 
that the zener resistance is relatively small.
The data sheet contains a lot of additional information, but it is primar-
ily aimed at designers. If you do get involved in design work, then you have to 
read the data sheet carefully, including the notes that specify how quantities were 
 measured.
Derating
The derating factor  shown on a data sheet tells you how much you have to re-
duce the power rating of a device. For instance, the 1N4728A series has a power 
rating of 1 W for a lead temperature of 50°C. The derating factor is given as 
6.67 mW/°C. This means that you have to subtract 6.67 mW for each degree above 
50°C. Even though you may not be involved in design, you have to be aware of the 
effect of temperature. If it is known that the lead temperature will be above 50°C, 
the designer has to derate or reduce the power rating of the zener diode.
5-6 Troubleshooting
Figure 5-16 shows a zener regulator. When the circuit is working properly, the 
voltage between A and ground is 118 V , the voltage between B and ground is 
110 V , and the voltage between C and ground is 110 V .
Unique Symptoms
Now, let’s discuss what can go wrong with the circuit. When a circuit is not work-
ing as it should, a troubleshooter usually starts by measuring voltages. These volt-
age measurements give clues that help isolate the trouble. For instance, suppose 
these voltages are measured:
VA 5 118 V    VB 5 110 V    VC 5 0
Here is what may go through a troubleshooter’s mind after measuring the forego-
ing voltages:
What if the load resistor were open? No, the load voltage would still be 
10 V . What if the load resistor were shorted? No, that would pull B and 
C down to ground, producing 0 V . All right, what if the connecting wire 
between B and C were open? Yes, that would do it.
This trouble produces unique symptoms. The only way you can get this set of 
voltages is with an open connection between B and C.
Ambiguous Symptoms
Not all troubles produce unique symptoms. Sometimes, two or more troubles pro-
duce the same set of voltages. Here is an example. Suppose the troubleshooter 
measures these voltages:
VA 5 118 V    VB 5 0    VC 5 0
What do you think the trouble is? Think about this for a few minutes. When you 
have an answer, read what follows.D1

_CFigure 5-16  Troubleshooting a 
zener regulator.160 Chapter 5Here is a way that a troubleshooter might fi  nd the trouble. The thinking 
goes like this:
I’ve got voltage at A, but not at B and C. What if the series resistor were 
open? Then no voltage could reach B or C, but I would still measure 
18 V between A and ground. Yes, the series resistor is probably open.
At this point, the troubleshooter would disconnect the series resistor and measure 
its resistance with an ohmmeter. Chances are that it would be open. But suppose it 
measures OK. Then the troubleshooter’s thinking continues like this:
That’s strange. Well, is there any other way I can get 18 V at A and 0 V 
at B and C? What if the zener diode were shorted? What if the load 
resistor were shorted? What if a solder splash were between B or C and 
ground? Any of these will produce the symptoms I’m getting.
Now the troubleshooter has more possible troubles to check out. Eventually, he or 
she will fi  nd the trouble.
When components burn out, they may become open, but not always. 
Some semiconductor devices can develop internal shorts, in which case they are 
like zero resistances. Other ways to get shorts include a solder splash between 
traces on a printed-circuit board, a solder ball touching two traces, and so on. 
 Because of this, you must include what-if questions in terms of shorted compo-
nents, as well as open components.
Table of Troubles
Summary Table 5-2 shows the possible troubles for the zener regulator in Fig. 5-16. 
In working out the voltages, remember this: A shorted component is equivalent 
to a resistance of zero, and an open component is equivalent to a resistance of 
infi nity. If you have trouble calculating with 0 and `, use 0.001 V and 1000 M V. 
In other words, use a very small resistance for a short and a very large resistance 
for an open.
In Fig. 5-16, the series resistor RS may be shorted or open. Let us des-
ignate these troubles as RSS and RSO. Similarly, the zener diode may be shorted 
or open, symbolized by D1S and D1O. Also, the load resistor may be shorted or 
open, RLS and RLO. Finally, the connecting wire between B and C may be open, 
designated BCO.

trouble is RSS, a shorted series resistor. When the series resistor is shorted in 
Fig. 5-16, 18 V appears at B and C. This destroys the zener diode and possibly the 
load resistor. For this trouble, a voltmeter measures 18 V at points A, B, and C. 
This trouble and its voltages are shown in Summary Table 5-2.
If the series resistor were open in Fig. 5-16, the voltage could not reach 
point B. In this case, B and C would have zero voltage, as shown in Summary Table 5-2. 
Continuing like this, we can get the remaining entries of Summary Table 5-2.
In Summary Table 5-2, the comments indicate troubles that might occur 
as a direct result of the original short circuits. For instance, a shorted RS will 
destroy the zener diode and may also open the load resistor. It depends on the 
power rating of the load resistor. A shorted RS means that there’s 18 V across 
1 kV. This produces a power of 0.324 W. If the load resistor is rated at only 
0.25 W, it may open.
Some of the troubles in Summary Table 5-2 produce unique voltages, and 
others produce ambiguous voltages. For instance, the voltages for RSS, D1O, BCO, 
and No supply are unique. If you measure these unique voltages, you can identify 
the trouble without breaking into the circuit to make an ohmmeter measurement.
On the other hand, all the other troubles in Summary Table 5-2 produce 
ambiguous voltages. This means that two or more troubles can produce the same 
set of voltages. If you measure a set of ambiguous voltages, you will need to break 
into the circuit and measure the resistance of the suspected components. For in-
stance, suppose you measure 18 V at A, 0 V at B, and 0 V at C. The troubles that 
can produce these voltages are RSO, D1S, and RLS.
Zener diodes can be tested in a variety of ways. A DMM set to the diode 
range will enable the diode to be tested for being open or shorted. A normal read-
ing will be approximately 0.7 V in the forward-biased direction and an open 
(overrange) indication in the reverse-biased direction. This test, though, will not 
indicate if the zener diode has the proper breakdown voltage VZ.
A semiconductor curve tracer, shown in Fig. 5-17, will accurately 
display the zener’s forward-/reverse-biased characteristics. If a curve tracer is not

connected in a circuit. The voltage drop should be close to its rated value.
5-7 Load Lines
The current through the zener diode of Fig. 5-18 a is given by:
IZ 5   VS 2 VZ _______  RS   
Suppose VS 5 20 V and RS 5 1 kV. Then, the foregoing equation reduces to:
IZ 5   20 2 VZ _______  1000  
We get the saturation point (vertical intercept) by setting VZ equal to zero and 
solving for IZ to get 20 mA. Similarly, to get the cutoff point (horizontal inter-
cept), we set IZ equal to zero and solve for VZ to get 20 V .
Alternatively, you can get the ends of the load line as follows. Visual-
ize Fig. 5-18 a with VS 5 20 V and RS 5 1 kV. With the zener diode shorted, 
the maximum diode current is 20 mA. With the diode open, the maximum diode 
voltage is 20 V .
Suppose the zener diode has a breakdown voltage of 12 V . Then its graph 
appears as shown in Fig. 5-18 b. When we plot the load line for VS 5 20 V and RS 5 
1 kV, we get the upper load line with an intersection point of Q1. The voltage 
across the zener diode will be slightly more than the knee voltage at breakdown 
because the curve slopes slightly.
To understand how voltage regulation works, assume that the source 
voltage changes to 30 V . Then, the zener current changes to:
IZ 5   30 2 VZ _______  1000  
This implies that the ends of the load line are 30 mA and 30 V , as shown in 
Fig. 5-18 b. The new intersection is at Q2. Compare Q2 with Q1, and you can see 
that there is more current through the zener diode, but approximately the same 
zener voltage. Therefore, even though the source voltage has changed from 20 to 
30 V , the zener voltage is still approximately equal to 12 V . This is the basic 
idea of voltage regulation; the output voltage has remained almost constant even 
though the input voltage has changed by a large amount.
5-8 Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs)
Optoelectronics  is the technology that combines optics and electronics. This fi  eld 
includes many devices based on the action of a pn junction. Examples of optoelec-
tronic devices are light-emitting diodes  (LEDs ), photodiodes, optocouplers, and 
laser diodes. Our discussion begins with the LED.
Light-Emitting Diode
LEDs have replaced incandescent lamps in many applications because of the 
LED’s lower energy consumption, smaller size, faster switching and longer life-
time. Figure 5-19 shows the parts of a standard low-power LED. Just as in an 
ordinary diode, the LED has an anode and a cathode that must be properly biased. 
The outside of the plastic case typically has a fl  at spot on one side which indicates VI

Figure 5-20 a shows a source connected to a resistor and an LED. The 
outward arrows symbolize the radiated light. In a forward-biased LED, free elec-
trons cross the pn junction and fall into holes. As these electrons fall from a higher 
to a lower energy level, they radiate energy in the form of photons. In ordinary 
diodes, this energy is radiated in the form of heat. But in an LED, the energy is 
radiated as light. This effect is referred to as electroluminescence.
The color of the light, which corresponds to the wavelength energy of 
the photons, is primarily determined by the energy band gap of the semiconductor 
materials that are used. By using elements like gallium, arsenic, and phosphorus, 
a manufacturer can produce LEDs that radiate red, green, yellow, blue, orange, Epoxy lens/case

as indicators in applications such as instrumentation panels, internet routers, and 
so on. The infrared LED fi  nds applications in security systems, remote controls, 
industrial control systems, and other areas requiring invisible radiation. 
LED Voltage and Current
The resistor of Fig. 5-20 b is the usual current-limiting resistor that prevents the 
current from exceeding the maximum current rating of the diode. Since the resis-
tor has a node voltage of VS on the left and a node voltage of VD on the right, the 
voltage across the resistor is the difference between the two voltages. With Ohm’s 
law, the series current is:
IS 5   VS 2 VD ________  RS   (5-13)
For most commercially available low-power LEDs, the typical voltage 
drop is from 1.5 to 2.5 V for currents between 10 and 50 mA. The exact voltage 
drop depends on the LED current, color, tolerance, along with other factors. Un-
less otherwise specifi  ed, we will use a nominal drop of 2 V when troubleshooting 
or analyzing low-power LED  circuits in this book. Figure 5-20 c shows typical 
low-power LEDs with housings made to help radiate the respective color.
LED Brightness
The brightness of an LED depends on the current. The amount of light emit-
ted is often specifi  ed as its luminous intensity  IV and is rated in candelas (cd). 
Low-power LEDs generally have their ratings given in millicandelas (mcd). For 
instance, a TLDR5400 is a red LED with a forward voltage drop of 1.8 V and an 
IV rating of 70 mcd at 20 mA. The luminous intensity drops to 3 mcd at a current 
of 1 mA. When VS is much greater than VD in Eq. (5-13), the brightness of the 
LED is approximately constant. If a circuit like Fig. 5-20 b is mass-produced using 
a TLDR5400, the brightness of the LED will be almost constant if VS is much 
greater than VD. If VS is only slightly more than VD, the LED brightness will vary 
noticeably from one circuit to the next.
The best way to control the brightness is by driving the LED with a cur-
rent source. This way, the brightness is constant because the current is constant. 
When we discuss transistors (they act like current sources), we will show how to 
use a transistor to drive an LED.
LED Speciﬁ  cations and Characteristics
A partial datasheet of a standard TLDR5400 5 mm T-1¾ red LED is shown 
in Figure 5-21. This type of LED has thru-hole leads and can be used in many 
applications.
The Absolute Maximum Rating table specifi  es that the LED’s maximum 
forward current IF is 50 mA and its maximum reverse voltage is only 6 V . To ex-
tend the life of this device, be sure to use an appropriate safety factor. The LED’s 
maximum power rating is 100 mW at an ambient temperature of 25˚C and must 
be derated at higher temperatures.
The Optical and Electrical Characteristics table indicates that this LED has 
a typical luminous intensity IV of 70 mcd at 20 mA and drops to 3 mcd at 1 mA. Also 
specifi  ed in this table, the dominant wavelength of the red LED is 648 nanometers 
and the light intensity drops off to approximately 50 percent when viewed at a 30° 
angle. The Relative Luminous Intensity versus Forward Current graph displays how 
the light intensity is effected by the LED’s forward current. The graph of Relative 
Luminous Intensity versus Wavelength visually displays how the luminous intensity 
reaches a peak at a wavelength of approximately 650 nanometers.Special-Purpose Diodes  165Figure 5-21  TLDR5400 Partial Datasheet. Datasheets courtesy of Vishay Intertechnology.

Figure 5-22 b is a continuity tester. After you turn off all the power in a circuit 
under test, you can use this circuit to check for the continuity of cables, connectors, 
and switches. How much LED current is there if the series resistance is 470 V?

decreases? The graph of Relative Luminous Intensity versus Ambient Tempera-
ture shows that an increase in ambient temperature has a substantial negative ef-
fect on the LED’s light output. This becomes important when LEDs are used in 
applications with large temperature variations.Special-Purpose Diodes  167
Application Example 5-14
LEDs are often used to indicate the existence of ac voltages. Figure 5-23 shows an 
ac voltage source driving an LED indicator. When there is ac voltage, there is LED 
current on the positive half-cycles. On the negative half-cycles, the rectifi  er diode 
turns on and protects the LED from too much reverse voltage. If the ac source volt-
age is 20 V rms and the series resistance is 680 V, what is the  average LED current? 
Also, calculate the approximate power dissipation in the series resistor.
SOLUTION   The LED current is a rectifi  ed half-wave signal. The peak source 
voltage is 1.414 3 20 V , which is approximately 28 V . Ignoring the LED voltage 
drop, the approximate peak current is:
IS 5   28 V ______ 680 V   5 41.2 mA
The average of the half-wave current through the LED is:
IS 5   41.2 mA ________  p   5 13.1 mA
Ignore the diode drops in Fig. 5-23; this is equivalent to saying that there 
is a short to ground on the right end of the series resistor. Then the power dissipa-
tion in the series resistor equals the square of the source voltage divided by the 
resistance:
P 5   (20 V)2 _______ 680 V  5 0.588 W
As the source voltage in Fig. 5-23 increases, the power dissipation in the series re-
sistor may increase to several watts. This is a disadvantage because a high-wattage 
resistor is too bulky and wasteful for most applications.

Application Example 5-15
The circuit of Fig. 5-24 shows an LED indicator for the ac power line. The idea 
is basically the same as in Fig. 5-23, except that we use a capacitor instead of a 
resistor. If the capacitance is 0.68 /H9262F, what is the average LED current?168 Chapter 5High-Power LEDs
Typical power dissipation levels of the LEDs discussed up to this point are in the 
low milliwatt range. As an example, the TLDR5400 LED has a maximum power 
rating of 100 mW and generally operates at approximately 20 mA with a typical 
forward voltage drop of 1.8 V . This results in a power dissipation of 36 mW.
SOLUTION   Calculate the capacitive reactance:
XC 5   1 _____ 2/H9266fC   5   1 _________________   2/H9266(60 Hz)(0.68 /H9262F)   5 3.9 k V
Ignoring the LED voltage drop, the approximate peak LED current is:
IS 5   170 V ______ 3.9 k V   5 43.6 mA
The average LED current is:
IS 5   43.6 mA ________  p   5 13.9 mA
What advantage does a series capacitor have over a series resistor? Since 
the voltage and current in a capacitor are 90° out of phase, there is no power dis-
sipation in the capacitor. If a 3.9-k V resistor were used instead of a capacitor, it 
would have a power dissipation of approximately 3.69 W. Most designers would 
prefer to use a capacitor, since it’s smaller and ideally produces no heat.
Application Example 5-16
What does the circuit of Fig. 5-25 do?
SOLUTION   This is a blown-fuse indicator.  If the fuse is OK, the LED is 
off because there is approximately zero voltage across the LED indicator. On the 
other hand, if the fuse is open, some of the line voltage appears across the LED 
indicator and the LED lights up.120 V

Power Emitter.  
High-power LEDs are now available with continuous power ratings of 
1 W and above. These power LEDs can operate in the hundreds of mAs to over 
1 A of current. An increasing array of applications are being developed including 
automotive interior, exterior, and forward lighting, architectural indoor and out-
door area lighting, along with digital imaging and display backlighting.
Figure 5-26 shows an example of a high-power LED emitter that has the 
benefi  t of high luminance for directional applications such as downlights and in-
door area lighting. LEDs, such as this, use much larger semiconductor die sizes to 
handle the large power inputs. Because this device will need to dissipate over 1 W 
of power, it is critical to use proper mounting techniques to a heat sink. Otherwise, 
the LED will fail within a short period of time.
Effi ciency of a light source is an essential factor in most applications. 
Because an LED produces both light and heat, it is important to understand how 
much electrical power is used to produce the light output. A term used to describe 
this is called luminous effi  cacy. Luminous effi  cacy  of  a source is the ratio of 
output luminous fl  ux (lm) to electrical power (W) given in lm/W. Figure 5-27 
shows a partial table for LUXEON TX high-power LED emitters giving their 
typical performance characteristics. Notice that the performance characteristics 
are rated at 350 mA, 700 mA, and 1,000 mA. With a test current of 700 mA, the 
LIT2-3070000000000 emitter has a typical luminous fl  ux output of 245 lm. At 
this forward current level, the typical forward voltage drop is 2.80 V . Therefore, 
the amount of power dissipated is P D 5 IF 3 VF 5 700 mA 3 2.80 V 5 1.96 W. 
The effi  cacy value for this emitter would be found by:
Effi cacy 5   lm ___ W   5   245 lm _______ 1.96 W   5 125 lm/W
As a comparison, the luminous effi  cacy of a typical incandescent bulb is 
16 lm/W and a compact fl  uorescent bulb has a typical rating of 60 lm/W. When 
looking at the overall effi  ciency of these types of LEDs, it is important to note 
that electronic circuits, called drivers, are required to control the LED’s current 
and light output. Since these drivers also use electrical power, the overall system 
effi ciency is reduced.

Besides standard low-power through high-power LEDs, there are many other op-
toelectronic devices which are based on the photonic action of a pn junction. 
These devices are used to source, detect and control light in an enormous variety 
of electronic applications. 
Seven-Segment Display
Figure 5-28 a shows a seven-segment  display.  It contains seven rectangular LEDs 
(A through G). Each LED is called a segment  because it forms part of the char-
acter being displayed. Figure 5-28 b is a schematic diagram of the seven-segment 
display. External series resistors are included to limit the currents to safe levels. 
By grounding one or more resistors, we can form any digit from 0 through 9. 
For instance, by grounding A, B, and C, we get a 7. Grounding A, B, C, D, and G 
 produces a 3.
A seven-segment display can also display capital letters A, C, E, and F, 
plus lowercase letters b and d. Microprocessor trainers often use seven-segment 
displays that show all digits from 0 through 9, plus A, b, C, d, E, and F.
The seven-segment indicator of Fig. 5-28 b is referred to as the common-
anode  type because all anodes are connected together. Also available is the 
common-cathode  type, in which all cathodes are connected together. Figure 5-28 c 
shows an actual seven-segment display with pins for fi  tting into a socket or for 
soldering to a printed-circuit board. Notice the extra dot segment used for a deci-
mal point.
Photodiode
As previously discussed, one component of reverse current in a diode is the fl  ow 
of minority carriers. These carriers exist because thermal energy keeps dislodg-
ing valence electrons from their orbits, producing free electrons and holes in the 
process. The lifetime of the minority carriers is short, but while they exist, they 
can contribute to the reverse current.
When light energy bombards a pn junction, it can dislodge valence 
electrons. The more light striking the junction, the larger the reverse current in a 
diode. A photodiode  has been optimized for its sensitivity to light. In this diode, 
a window lets light pass through the package to the junction. The incoming light 
produces free electrons and holes. The stronger the light, the greater the number 
of minority carriers and the larger the reverse current.
Figure 5-29 shows the schematic symbol of a photodiode. The arrows 
represent the incoming light. Especially important, the source and the series 
 resistor reverse-bias the photodiode. As the light becomes brighter, the reverse 
current increases. With typical photodiodes, the reverse current is in the tens of 
microamperes.GOOD TO KNOW
The principal disadvantage of 
LEDs is that they draw consider-
able current in comparison to 
other types of visual displays. 
In many cases, LEDs are pulsed 
on and off at  a rapid rate, rather 
than being supplied with a 
steady drive current. LEDs ap-
pear to the eye to be on con-
tinuously, but they consume 
less power than if they were on 
continuously.

Optocoupler
An optocoupler (also called an optoisolator ) combines an LED and a photodiode 
in a single package. Figure 5-30 shows an optocoupler. It has an LED on the input 
side and a photodiode on the output side. The left source voltage and the series 
 resistor set up a current through the LED. Then the light from the LED hits the 
photodiode, and this sets up a reverse current in the output circuit. This reverse 
current produces a voltage across the output resistor. The output voltage then 
equals the output supply voltage minus the voltage across the resistor.
When the input voltage is varying, the amount of light is fl  uctuating. This 
means that the output voltage is varying in step with the input voltage. This is why 
the combination of an LED and a photodiode is called an optocoupler.  The device 
can couple an input signal to the output circuit. Other types of optocouplers use 
phototransistors, photothyristors, and other photo devices in their output  circuit 
side. These devices will be discussed in later chapters.
The key advantage of an optocoupler is the electrical isolation between 
the input and output circuits. With an optocoupler, the only contact between the 
input and the output is a beam of light. Because of this, it is possible to have an 
insulation resistance between the two circuits in the thousands of megohms. Isola-
tion like this is useful in high-voltage applications in which the potentials of the 
two circuits may differ by several thousand volts.
Laser Diode
In an LED, free electrons radiate light when falling from higher energy levels to 
lower ones. The free electrons fall randomly and continuously, resulting in light 
waves that have every phase between 0 and 360°. Light that has many different 
phases is called noncoherent light.  An LED produces noncoherent light.
A laser diode  is different. It produces a coherent light.  This means that 
all the light waves are in phase with each other.  The basic idea of a laser diode 
is to use a mirrored resonant chamber that reinforces the emission of light waves 
at a single frequency of the same phase. Because of the resonance, a laser diode 
produces a narrow beam of light that is very intense, focused, and pure.
Laser diodes are also known as semiconductor lasers.  These diodes can 
produce visible light (red, green, or blue) and invisible light (infrared). Laser di-
odes are used in a large variety of applications. They are used in telecommuni-
cations, data communications, broadband access, industrial, aerospace, test and 
measurement, and medical and defense industries. They are also used in laser 
printers and consumer products requiring large-capacity optical disk systems, 
such as compact disk (CD) and digital video disk (DVD) players. In broadband 
communication, they are used with fi  ber-optic cables to increase the speed of the 
 Internet.
A fi  ber-optic cable  is analogous to a stranded wire cable, except that 
the strands are thin fl  exible fi  bers of glass or plastic that transmit light beams in-
stead of free electrons. The advantage is that much more information can be sent 
through a fi  ber-optic cable than through a copper cable.GOOD TO KNOW
An important specification for 
the optocoupler is its current/
transfer ratio, which is the ratio 
of the device’s output (photodi-
ode or phototransistor) current 
to its input (LED) current.172 Chapter 5New applications are being found as the lasing wavelength is pushed 
lower into the visible spectrum with visible laser diodes (VLDs). Also, near- 
infrared diodes are being used in machine vision systems, sensors, and security 
systems.
5-10  The Schottky Diode
As frequency increases, the action of small-signal rectifi  er diodes begins to deteri-
orate. They are no longer able to switch off fast enough to produce a well- defi  ned 
half-wave signal. The solution to this problem is the Schottky diode.   Before de-
scribing this special-purpose diode, let us look at the problem that arises with 
ordinary small-signal diodes.
Charge Storage
Figure 5-31 a shows a small-signal diode, and Fig. 5-31 b illustrates its energy 
bands. As you can see, conduction-band electrons have diffused across the junc-
tion and traveled into the p region before recombining (path A). Similarly, holes 
have crossed the junction and traveled into the n region before recombination 
 occurs (path B). The greater the lifetime, the farther the charges can travel before 
recombination occurs.
For instance, if the lifetime equals 1 /H9262s, free electrons and holes exist for 
an average of 1 /H9262s before recombination takes place. This allows the free elec-
trons to penetrate deeply into the p region, where they remain temporarily stored 
at the higher energy band. Similarly, the holes penetrate deeply into the n region, 
where they are temporarily stored in the lower energy band.
The greater the forward current, the larger the number of charges that 
have crossed the junction. The greater the lifetime, the deeper the penetration of 
these charges and the longer the charges remain in the high and low energy bands. 
The temporary storage of free electrons in the upper energy band and holes in the 
lower energy band is referred to as charge storage.
Charge Storage Produces Reverse Current
When you try to switch a diode from on to off, charge storage creates a problem. 
Why? Because if you suddenly reverse-bias a diode, the stored charges will fl  ow 
in the reverse direction for a while. The greater the lifetime, the longer these 
charges can contribute to reverse current.
For example, suppose a forward-biased diode is suddenly reverse biased, 
as shown in Fig. 5-32 a. Then a large reverse current can exist for a while because GOOD TO KNOW
Schottky diodes are relatively 
high-current devices, capable of 
switching quickly while providing 
forward currents in the neigh-
borhood of 50 A! It is also worth 
noting that Schottky diodes 
normally have lower breakdown 
voltage ratings as compared to 
conventional pn junction rectifier 
diodes.

(b) stored charges in high and low energy bands.Special-Purpose Diodes  173of the fl  ow of stored charges in Fig. 5-32 b. Until the stored charges either cross 
the junction or recombine, the reverse current will continue.
Reverse Recovery Time
The time it takes to turn off a forward-biased diode is called the reverse recovery 
time t rr. The conditions for measuring trr vary from one manufacturer to the next. 
As a guide, trr is the time it takes for the reverse current to drop to 10 percent of 
the forward current.
For instance, the 1N4148 has a trr of 4 ns. If this diode has a forward 
current of 10 mA and it is suddenly reverse biased, it will take approximately 
4 ns for the reverse current to decrease to 1 mA. Reverse recovery time is so short 
in small-signal diodes that you don’t even notice its effect at frequencies below 
10 MHz or so. It’s only when you get well above 10 MHz that you have to take 
trr into account.
Poor Rectiﬁ  cation at High Frequencies
What effect does reverse recovery time have on rectifi  cation? Take a look at 
the half-wave rectifi  er shown in Fig. 5-33 a. At low frequencies, the output is a 
half-wave rectifi  ed signal. As the frequency increases well into megahertz, how-
ever, the output signal begins to deviate from the half-wave shape, as shown in 
Fig. 5-33 b. Some reverse conduction (called tails) is noticeable near the begin-
ning of the reverse half-cycle.
The problem is that the reverse recovery time has become a signifi  cant 
part of the period, allowing conduction during the early part of the negative half-
cycle. For instance, if trr 5 4 ns and the period is 50 ns, the early part of the  reverse 
half-cycle will have tails similar to those shown in Fig. 5-33 b. As the  frequency 
continues to increase, the rectifi  er becomes useless.(a)( b)ENERGY ELECTRON

(a)( b)Figure 5-34  Schottky diodes eliminate tails at high frequencies. ( a) Circuit with 
Schottky diode; ( b) half-wave signal at 300 MHz.Eliminating Charge Storage
The solution to the problem of tails is a special-purpose device called a Schottky 
diode.  This kind of diode uses a metal such as gold, silver, or platinum on one 
side of the junction and doped silicon (typically n-type) on the other side. Because 
of the metal on one side of the junction, the Schottky diode has no depletion 
layer. The lack of a depletion layer means that there are no stored charges at the 
junction.
When a Schottky diode is unbiased, free electrons on the n side are in 
smaller orbits than are the free electrons on the metal side. This difference in 
orbit size is called the Schottky barrier,  approximately 0.25 V . When the diode is 
 forward biased, free electrons on the n side can gain enough energy to travel in 
larger orbits. Because of this, free electrons can cross the junction and enter the 
metal, producing a large forward current. Since the metal has no holes, there is no 
charge storage and no reverse recovery time.
Hot-Carrier Diode
The Schottky diode is sometimes called a hot-carrier diode.  This name came 
about as follows. Forward bias increases the energy of the electrons on the n side 
to a higher level than that of the electrons on the metal side of the junction. This 
increase in energy inspired the name hot carrier  for the n-side electrons. As soon 
as these high-energy electrons cross the junction, they fall into the metal, which 
has a lower-energy conduction band.
High-Speed Turnoff  
The lack of charge storage means that the Schottky diode can switch off faster 
than an ordinary diode can. In fact, a Schottky diode can easily rectify frequencies 
above 300 MHz. When it is used in a circuit like Fig. 5-34 a, the Schottky diode 
produces a perfect half-wave signal like Fig. 5-34 b even at frequencies above 
300 MHz.
Figure 5-34 a shows the schematic symbol of a Schottky diode. Notice 
the cathode side. The lines look like a rectangular S, which stands for Schottky.  
This is how you can remember the schematic symbol.
Applications
The most important application of Schottky diodes is in digital computers. The 
speed of computers depends on how fast their diodes and transistors can turn on 
and off. This is where the Schottky diode comes in. Because it has no charge stor-
age, the Schottky diode has become the backbone of low-power Schottky TTLs, a 
group of widely used digital devices.Special-Purpose Diodes  175A fi  nal point. Since a Schottky diode has a barrier potential of only 0.25 V , 
you may occasionally see it used in low-voltage bridge rectifi  ers because you 
subtract only 0.25 V instead of the usual 0.7 V for each diode when using the 
 second approximation. In a low-voltage supply, this lower diode voltage drop is 
an advantage.
5-11 The Varactor
The varactor  (also called the voltage-variable capacitance, varicap, epicap,  and 
tuning diode ) is widely used in television receivers, FM receivers, and other com-
munications equipment because it can be used for electronic tuning.
Basic Idea
In Fig. 5-35 a, the depletion layer is between the p region and the n region. The p
and n regions are like the plates of a capacitor, and the depletion layer is like the di-
electric. When a diode is reverse biased, the width of the depletion layer increases 
with the reverse voltage. Since the depletion layer gets wider with more reverse 
voltage, the capacitance becomes smaller. It’s as though you moved apart the plates 
of a capacitor. The key idea is that capacitance is controlled by reverse voltage.
Equivalent Circuit and Symbol
Figure 5-35 b shows the ac-equivalent circuit for a reverse-biased diode. In other 
words, as far as an ac signal is concerned, the varactor acts the same as a variable 
capacitance. Figure 5-35 c shows the schematic symbol for a varactor. The inclu-
sion of a capacitor in series with the diode is a reminder that a varactor is a device 
that has been optimized for its variable-capacitance properties.
Capacitance Decreases at 
Higher Reverse Voltages
Figure 5-35 d shows how the capacitance varies with reverse voltage. This graph 
shows that the capacitance gets smaller when the reverse voltage gets larger. The 
really important idea here is that reverse dc voltage controls capacitance.
How is a varactor used? It is connected in parallel with an inductor to 
form a parallel resonant circuit. This circuit has only one frequency at which 
maximum impedance occurs. This frequency is called the resonant frequency.  If 
the dc reverse voltage to the varactor is changed, the resonant frequency is also 
changed. This is the principle behind electronic tuning of a radio station, a TV 
channel, and so on.
Varactor Characteristics
Because the capacitance is voltage controlled, varactors have replaced mechani-
cally tuned capacitors in many applications such as television receivers and 
 automobile radios. Data sheets for varactors list a reference value of capacitance 
measured at a specifi  c reverse voltage, typically 23 V to 24 V . Figure 5-36 shows 
a partial data sheet for an MV209 varactor diode. It lists a reference capacitance 
Ct of 29 pF at –3 V .
In addition to providing the reference value of capacitance, data sheets 
normally list a capacitance ratio CR, or tuning range associated with a voltage range. 
For example, along with the reference value of 29 pF, the data sheet of an MV209 
shows a minimum capacitance ratio of 5:1 for a voltage range of –3 V to –25 V . 
This means that the capacitance, or tuning range, decreases from 29 to 6 pF when 
the voltage varies from –3 V to –25 V .+  +  +

Fig. 5-37 a shows the doping profi  le for an abrupt-junction diode (the ordinary 
type of diode). The profi  le shows that the doping is uniform on both sides of the 
junction. The tuning range of an abrupt-junction diode is between 3:1 and 4:1.
To get larger tuning ranges, some varactors have a hyperabrupt junc-
tion, one whose doping profi  le looks like Fig. 5-37 b. This profi  le tells us that 
the  doping level increases as we approach the junction. The heavier doping 
produces a narrower depletion layer and a larger capacitance. Furthermore, 
changes in reverse voltage have more pronounced effects on capacitance. A hy-
perabrupt varactor has a tuning range of about 10:1, enough to tune an AM radio 
through its frequency range of 535 to 1605 kHz. (Note: You need a 10:1 range 
because the resonant frequency is inversely proportional to the square root of 
capacitance.)40

Besides the special-purpose diodes discussed so far, there are others you should 
know about. Because they are so specialized, only a brief description follows.
Varistors
Lightning, power-line faults, and transients can pollute the ac line voltage by 
 superimposing dips and spikes on the normal 120 V rms. Dips  are severe voltage 
drops lasting microseconds or less. Spikes  are very brief overvoltages up to 2000 V 
or more. In some equipment, fi  lters are used between the power line and the pri-
mary of the transformer to eliminate the problems caused by ac line transients.
Application Example 5-17
What does the circuit of Fig. 5-38 a do?
SOLUTION   A transistor is a semiconductor device that acts like a current 
source. In Fig. 5-38 a, the transistor pumps a fi  xed number of milliamperes into 
the resonant LC tank circuit. A negative dc voltage reverse-biases the varactor. 
By varying this dc control voltage, we can vary the resonant frequency of the LC 
circuit.
As far as the ac signal is concerned, we can use the equivalent circuit 
shown in Fig. 5-38 b. The coupling capacitor acts like a short circuit. An ac cur-
rent source drives a resonant LC tank circuit. The varactor acts like variable ca-
pacitance, which means that we can change the resonant frequency by changing 
the dc control voltage. This is the basic idea behind the tuning of some radio and 
television receivers.

transient suppressor ). This semiconductor device is like two back-to-back zener 
diodes with a high breakdown voltage in both directions. Varistors are commer-
cially available with breakdown voltages from 10 to 1000 V . They can handle peak 
transient currents in the hundreds or thousands of amperes.
For instance, a V130LA2 is a varistor with a breakdown voltage of 184 V 
(equivalent to 130 V rms) and a peak current rating of 400 A. Connect one of these 
across the primary winding as shown in Fig. 5-39 a, and you don’t have to worry 
about spikes. The varistor will clip all spikes at the 184-V level and protect your 
power supply.
Current-Regulator Diodes
These are diodes that work in a way exactly opposite to the way zener diodes 
work. Instead of holding the voltage constant, these diodes hold the current con-
stant. Known as current-regulator diodes  (or constant-current diodes ), these 
devices keep the current through them fi  xed when the voltage changes. For exam-
ple, the 1N5305 is a constant-current diode with a typical current of 2 mA over a 
voltage range of 2 to 100 V . Figure 5-39 b shows the schematic symbol of a current-
regulator diode. In Fig. 5-39 b, the diode will hold the load current constant at 2 mA 
even though the load resistance varies from 1 to 49 k V.
Step-Recovery Diodes
The step-recovery diode  has the unusual doping profi  le shown in Fig. 5-40 a. 
This graph indicates that the density of carriers decreases near the junction. This 
unusual distribution of carriers causes a phenomenon called reverse snap-off.
Figure 5-40 b shows the schematic symbol for a step-recovery diode. 
During the positive half-cycle, the diode conducts like any silicon diode. But 
 during the negative half-cycle, reverse current exists for a while because of the 
stored charges and then suddenly drops to zero.
Figure 5-40 c shows the output voltage. It’s as though the diode con-
ducts reverse current for a while and then suddenly snaps open. This is why the C120 V ac

rich in harmonics and can be fi  ltered to produce a sine wave of a higher frequency. 
(Harmonics  are multiples of the input frequency like 2 fin, 3fin, and 4 fin.) Because 
of this, step-recovery diodes are useful in frequency multipliers, circuits whose 
output frequency is a multiple of the input frequency.
Back Diodes
Zener diodes normally have breakdown voltages greater than 2 V . By increasing 
the doping level, we can get the zener effect to occur near zero. Forward conduc-
tion still occurs around 0.7 V , but now reverse conduction (breakdown) starts at 
approximately 20.1 V .
A diode with a graph like Fig. 5-41 a is called a back diode  because it 
conducts better in the reverse than in the forward direction. Figure 5-41 b shows 
a sine wave with a peak of 0.5 V driving a back diode and a load resistor. (Notice 
that the zener symbol is used for the back diode.) The 0.5 V is not enough to turn 
on the diode in the forward direction, but it is enough to break down the diode in 
the reverse direction. For this reason, the output is a half-wave signal with a peak 
of 0.4 V , as shown in Fig. 5-41 b.
Back diodes are occasionally used to rectify weak signals with peak am-
plitudes between 0.1 and 0.7 V .
Tunnel Diodes
By increasing the doping level of a back diode, we can get breakdown to occur at 0 V . 
Furthermore, the heavier doping distorts the forward curve, as shown in Fig. 5-42 a. 
A diode with this graph is called a tunnel diode.
Figure 5-42 b shows the schematic symbol for a tunnel diode. This type 
of diode exhibits a phenomenon known as negative resistance.  This means that 
an increase in forward voltage produces a decrease in forward current, at least 
over the part of the graph between VP and VV. The negative resistance of tunnel 180 Chapter 5SERIES RESISTANCE, RS

diodes is useful in high-frequency circuits called oscillators.  These circuits are 
able to generate a sinusoidal signal, similar to that produced by an ac generator. 
But unlike the ac generator that converts mechanical energy to a sinusoidal signal, 
an oscillator converts dc energy to a sinusoidal signal. Later chapters will show 
you how to build oscillators.

PIN Diodes
A PIN diode  is a semiconductor device that operates as a variable resistor at RF 
and microwave frequencies. Figure 5-43 a shows its construction. It consists of an 
intrinsic (pure) semiconductor material sandwiched between p-type and n-type 
materials. Figure 5-43 b shows the schematic symbol for the PIN diode.
When the diode is forward biased, it acts like a current-controlled re-
sistance. Figure 5-43 c shows how the PIN diode’s series resistance RS decreases 
as its forward current increases. When reverse biased, the PIN diode acts like a 
fi xed capacitor. The PIN diode is widely used in modulator circuits for RF and 
microwave applications.
Table of Devices
Summary Table 5-3 lists all the special-purpose devices in this chapter. The zener 
diode is useful in voltage regulators, the LED as a dc or an ac indicator, the seven-
segment indicator in measuring instruments, and so on. You should study the table 
and remember the ideas it contains.
Summary
SEC. 5-1  THE ZENER DIODE
This is a special diode optimized for 
operation in the breakdown region. 
Its main use is in voltage regulators—
circuits that hold the load voltage 
constant. Ideally, a reverse-biased 
zener diode is like a perfect battery. 
To a second approximation, it has a 
bulk resistance that produces a small 
additional voltage.
SEC. 5-2   THE LOADED ZENER 
REGULATOR
When a zener diode is in parallel with 
a load resistor, the current through 
the current-limiting resistor equals 
the sum of the zener current and the 
load current. The process for analyz-
ing a zener regulator consists of ﬁ  nd-
ing the series current, load current, 
and zener current (in that order).
SEC. 5-3   SECOND 
APPROXIMATION 
OF A ZENER DIODE
In the second approximation, we vi-
sualize a zener diode as a battery of 
VZ and a series resistance of RZ. The 
current through RZ produces an ad-
ditional voltage across the diode, but 
this voltage  is usually small. You need 
zener resistance in order to calculate 
ripple reduction.SEC. 5-4   ZENER DROP-OUT 
POINT
A zener regulator will fail to regu-
late if the zener diode comes out of 
breakdown. The worst-case condi-
tions occur for minimum source 
voltage, maximum series resistance, 
and minimum load resistance. For 
the zener regulator to work properly 
under all operating conditions, there 
must be zener current under the 
worst-case conditions.
SEC. 5-5   READING A DATA 
SHEET
The most important quantities on the 
data sheet of zener diodes are the 
zener voltage, the maximum power 
rating, the maximum current rating, 
and the tolerance. Designers also 
need the zener resistance, the 
derating factor, and a few other 
items.
SEC. 5-6  TROUBLESHOOTING
Troubleshooting is an art and a sci-
ence. Because of this, you can learn 
only so much from a book. The rest 
has to be learned from direct experi-
ence with circuits in trouble. Because 
troubleshooting is an art, you have 
to ask “What if?” often and feel your 
way to a solution.SEC. 5-7  LOAD LINES
The intersection of the load line and 
the zener diode graph is the Q point. 
When the source voltage changes, 
a diff  erent load line appears with a 
diff erent Q point. Although the two Q 
points may have diff  erent currents, 
the voltages are almost identical. 
This is a visual demonstration of volt-
age regulation.
SEC. 5-8   LIGHT-EMITTING 
DIODES (LEDS)
The LED is widely used as an indica-
tor on instruments, calculators, and 
other electronic equipment. High-
intensity LEDs off  er high luminous 
effi  cacy (lm/W) and are ﬁ  nding their 
way into many applications.
SEC. 5-9   OTHER OPTOELEC-
TRONIC DEVICES
By combining seven LEDs in a pack-
age, we get a seven-segment indica-
tor. Another important optoelectronic 
device is the optocoupler, which 
allows us to couple a signal between 
two isolated circuits.
SEC. 5-10   THE SCHOTTKY 
DIODE
The reverse recovery time is the 
time it takes a diode to shut off   182 Chapter 5after it is suddenly switched from 
forward to reverse bias. This time 
may be only a few nanoseconds, 
but it places a limit on how high the 
frequency can be in a rectiﬁ  er 
circuit. The Schottky diode is a 
special diode with almost zero 
reverse recovery time. Because 
of this, the Schottky diode is 
useful at high frequencies where 
short switching times are 
needed.SEC. 5-11  THE VARACTOR
The width of the depletion layer 
increases with the reverse voltage. 
This is why the capacitance of a 
varactor can be controlled by the re-
verse voltage. A common application 
is remote tuning of radio and televi-
sion sets.
SEC. 5-12  OTHER DIODES
Varistors are useful as transient sup-
pressors. Constant-current diodes hold the current, rather than the volt-
age, constant. Step-recovery diodes 
snap off   and produce a step voltage 
that is rich in harmonics. Back diodes 
conduct better in the reverse direc-
tion than in the forward direction. 
Tunnel diodes exhibit negative re-
sistance, which can be used in high-
frequency oscillators. PIN diodes use 
a forward-biased control current to 
change its resistance in RF and mi-
crowave communication circuits.

In 1951, William Schockley invented the ﬁ  rst junction transistor,  
a semiconductor device that can amplify (enlarge) electronic 
signals such as radio and television signals. The transistor has 
led to many other semiconductor inventions, including the 
integrated circuit (IC), a small device that contains thousands of 
miniaturized transistors. Because of the IC, modern computers 
and other electronic miracles are possible.
 This chapter introduces the fundamental operation of a 
bipolar junction transistor (BJT), the kind that uses both free 
electrons and holes. The word bipolar is an abbreviation for 
“two polarities.” This chapter will also explore how this BJT can 
be properly biased to act as a switch.

A transistor has three doped regions, as shown in Fig. 6-1. The bottom region 
is  called the emitter,  the middle region is the base, and the top region is the 
 collector.  In an actual transistor, the base region is much thinner as compared to 
the collector and emitter regions. The transistor of Fig. 6-1 is an npn device  be-
cause there is a p region between two n regions. Recall that the majority carriers 
are free electrons in n-type material and holes in p-type material.
Transistors are also manufactured as pnp devices. A pnp transistor has an 
n region between two p regions. To avoid confusion between the npn and the pnp 
transistors, our early discussions will focus on the npn transistor.
Doping Levels
In Fig. 6-1, the emitter is heavily doped. On the other hand, the base is lightly 
doped. The doping level of the collector is intermediate, between the heavy dop-
ing of the emitter and the light doping of the base. The collector is physically the 
largest of the three regions.
Emitter and Collector Diodes
The transistor of Fig. 6-1 has two junctions: one between the emitter and the base, 
and another between the collector and the base. Because of this, a transistor is 
like two back-to-back diodes. The lower diode is called the emitter-base diode,  or 
simply the emitter diode.  The upper diode is called the collector-base diode,  or 
the collector diode.
Before and After Diff  usion
Figure 6-1 shows the transistor regions before diffusion has occurred. Because 
of their repulsion for each other, the free electrons in the n regions will spread in 
all directions. Some of the free electrons in the n region will diffuse across the 
junction and recombine with the holes in the p region. Visualize the free electrons 
in each n region crossing the junction and recombining with holes.
The result is two depletion layers, as shown in Fig. 6-2 a. For each of these 
depletion layers, the barrier potential is approximately 0.7 V at 25°C for a silicon

–Figure 6-1  Structure of a transistor.GOOD TO KNOW
During the afternoon of 
December 23, 1947, Walter H. 
Brattain and John Bardeen 
demonstrated the amplifying 
action of the first transistor at 
the Bell Telephone Laboratories. 
The first transistor was called a 
point-contact transistor , which 
was the predecessor to the 
junction transistor invented by 
Schockley.
GOOD TO KNOW
The transistor in Fig. 6-1 is 
 sometimes referred to as a  
 bipolar junction transistor , or 
BJT. However, most people in 
the electronics industry still use 
the word transistor , with the 
 understanding that a bipolar 
junction transistor is meant.BJT Fundamentals  191transistor (0.3 V at 25°C for a germanium transistor). As before, we emphasize 
 silicon devices because they are now more widely used than germanium devices.
6-2 The Biased Transistor
An unbiased transistor is like two back-to-back diodes, as shown in Fig. 6-2 b. 
Each diode has a barrier potential of approximately 0.7 V . Keep this diode equiv-
alent in mind when testing an npn transistor with a DMM. When you connect ex-
ternal voltage sources to the transistor, you will get currents through the different 
parts of the transistor.
Emitter Electrons
Figure 6-3 shows a biased transistor. The minus signs represent free electrons. 
The heavily doped emitter has the following job: to emit or inject its free electrons 
into the base. The lightly doped base also has a well-defi  ned purpose: to pass 
emitter-injected electrons on to the collector. The collector is so named because it 
collects or gathers most of the electrons from the base.
Figure 6-3 is the usual way to bias a transistor. The left source VBB of Fig. 6-3 
forward-biases the emitter diode, and the right source VCC reverse-biases the collector

and reverse-biasing the collector diode produce the most useful  results.
Base Electrons
At the instant that forward bias is applied to the emitter diode of Fig. 6-3, the 
electrons in the emitter have not yet entered the base region. If VBB is greater 
than the emitter-base barrier potential in Fig. 6-3, emitter electrons will enter the 
base  region, as shown in Fig. 6-4. Theoretically, these free electrons can fl  ow in 
either of two directions. First, they can fl  ow to the left and out of the base, passing 
through RB on the way to the positive source terminal. Second, the free electrons 
can fl  ow into the collector.
Which way will the free electrons go? Most will continue on to the col-
lector. Why? Two reasons: The base is lightly doped  and very thin.  The light dop-
ing means that the free electrons have a long lifetime in the base region. The very 
thin base means that the free electrons have only a short distance to go to reach 
the collector. For these two reasons, almost all the emitter-injected electrons pass 
through the base to the collector.
Only a few free electrons will recombine with holes in the lightly doped 
base of Fig. 6-4. Then, as valence electrons, they will fl  ow through the base resis-
tor to the positive side of the VBB supply.
Collector Electrons
Almost all the free electrons go into the collector, as shown in Fig. 6-5. Once they 
are in the collector, they feel the attraction of the VCC source voltage. Because of GOOD TO KNOW
In a transistor, the emitter-base 
depletion layer is narrower 
than the collector-base deple-
tion layer. The reason can be 
 attributed to the different doping 
levels of the emitter and collec-
tor regions. With much heavier 
doping in the emitter region, the 
penetration into the n material is 
minimal because of the availabil-
ity of many more free electrons. 
However, on the collector side, 
fewer free electrons are availa-
ble and the depletion layer must 
penetrate more deeply in order 
to set up the barrier potential.

the positive terminal of the collector supply voltage.
Here’s a summary of what’s going on: In Fig. 6-5, VBB forward-biases 
the emitter diode, forcing the free electrons in the emitter to enter the base. The 
thin and lightly doped base gives almost all these electrons enough time to diffuse 
into the collector. These electrons fl  ow through the collector, through RC, and into 
the positive terminal of the VCC voltage source.
6-3 Transistor Currents
Figures 6-6 a and 6-6 b show the schematic symbol for an npn transistor. If you 
prefer  conventional fl  ow, use Fig. 6-6 a. If you prefer electron fl  ow, use Fig. 6-6 b.
In Fig. 6-6, there are three different currents in a transistor: emitter current IE, base 
current IB, and collector current IC.
How the Currents Compare
Because the emitter is the source of the electrons, it has the largest current. Since 
most of the emitter electrons fl  ow to the collector, the collector current is almost 
as large as the emitter current. The base current is very small by comparison, often 
less than 1 percent of the collector current.
Relation of Currents
Recall Kirchhoff’s current law. It says that the sum of all currents into a point or 
junction equals the sum of all currents out of the point or junction. When applied 
to a transistor, Kirchhoff’s current law gives us this important relationship:
IE 5 IC 1 IB (6-1)
This says that the emitter current is the sum of the collector current and the base 
current. Since the base current is so small, the collector current approximately 
equals the emitter current:
IC < IE
and the base current is much smaller than the collector current:
IB ,, IC
(Note:  ,, means much smaller than .)
Figure 6-6 c shows the schematic symbol for a pnp transistor and its cur-
rents. Notice that the current directions are opposite that of the npn. Again  notice 
that Eq. (6-1) holds true for the pnp transistor currents.
Alpha
The dc alpha (symbolized /H9251dc) is defi  ned as the dc collector current divided by 
the dc emitter current:
adc 5 IC __ IE   (6-2)
Since the collector current almost equals the emitter current, the dc alpha is 
slightly less than 1. For instance, in a low-power transistor, the dc alpha is typi-
cally greater than 0.99. Even in a high-power transistor, the dc alpha is typically 
greater than 0.95.IBIC

The dc beta  (symbolized /H9252dc) of a transistor is defi  ned as the ratio of the dc col-
lector current to the dc base current:
bdc 5  IC __ IB   (6-3)
The dc beta is also known as the current gain  be cause a small base current con-
trols a much larger collector current.
The current gain is a major advantage of a transistor and has led to all 
kinds of applications. For low-power transistors (under 1 W), the current gain 
is typically 100 to 300. High-power transistors (over 1 W) usually have current 
gains of 20 to 100.
Two Derivations
Equation (6-3) may be rearranged into two equivalent forms. First, when you 
know the value of /H9252dc and IB, you can calculate the collector current with this 
 derivation:
IC 5 /H9252dcIB (6-4)
Second, when you have the value of /H9252dc and IC, you can calculate the base current 
with this derivation:
IB 5   IC ___ bdc   (6-5)
Example 6-1
A transistor has a collector current of 10 mA and a base current of 40 /H9262A. What 
is the current gain of the transistor?
SOLUTION   Divide the collector current by the base current to get:
/H9252dc 5   10 mA ______ 40 /H9262A   5 250
PRACTICE PROBLEM 6-1   What is the current gain of the transistor in 
Example 6-1 if its base current is 50 /H9262A?
Example 6-2
A transistor has a current gain of 175. If the base current is 0.1 mA, what is the 
collector current?
SOLUTION   Multiply the current gain by the base current to get:
IC 5 175(0.1 mA)  5 17.5 mA
PRACTICE PROBLEM 6-2   Find IC in Example 6-2 if /H9252dc 5 100.BJT Fundamentals  1956-4 The CE Connection
There are three useful ways to connect a transistor: with a CE (common emitter), 
a CC (common collector), or a CB (common base). The CC and CB connections 
are discussed in later chapters. In this chapter, we will focus on the CE connection 
because it is the most widely used.
Common Emitter
In Fig. 6-7 a, the common or ground side of each voltage source is connected to 
the emitter. Because of this, the circuit is called a common emitter (CE) connec-
tion. The circuit has two loops. The left loop is the base loop, and the right loop 
is the collector loop.

base current?

GOOD TO KNOW
The base loop is sometimes re-
ferred to as the input loop and 
the collector loop the output 
loop. In a CE connection, the 
input loop controls the output 
loop.196 Chapter 6In the base loop, the VBB source forward-biases the emitter diode with 
RB as a current-limiting resistance. By changing VBB or RB, we can change the 
base current. Changing the base current will change the collector current. In other 
words, the base current controls the collector current.  This is important. It means 
that a small current (base) controls a large current (collector).
In the collector loop, a source voltage VCC reverse-biases the collector 
diode through RC. The supply voltage VCC must reverse-bias the collector diode 
as shown, or else the transistor won’t work properly. Stated another way, the col-
lector must be positive in Fig. 6-7 a to collect most of the free electrons injected 
into the base.
In Fig. 6-7 a, the fl  ow of base current in the left loop produces a voltage 
across the base resistor RB with the polarity shown. Similarly, the fl  ow of collector 
current in the right loop produces a voltage across the collector resistor RC with 
the polarity shown. 
Double Subscripts
Double-subscript notation is used with transistor circuits. When the subscripts are 
the same, the voltage represents a source ( VBB and VCC). When the subscripts are 
different, the voltage is between the two points ( VBE and VCE).
For instance, the subscripts of VBB are the same, which means that VBB 
is the base voltage source. Similarly, VCC is the collector voltage source. On the 
other hand, VBE is the voltage between points B and E, between the base and the 
emitter. Likewise, VCE is the voltage between points C and E, between the col-
lector and the emitter. When measuring double-subscripted voltages, the main or 
positive meter probe is placed on the fi  rst subscript point and the common probe 
is connected to the second subscript point of the circuit.
Single Subscripts
Single subscripts are used for node voltages, that is, voltages between the sub-
scripted point and ground. For instance, if we redraw Fig. 6-7 a with grounds, 
we get Fig. 6-7 b. V oltage VB is the voltage between the base and ground, voltage 
VC is the voltage between the collector and ground, and voltage VE is the voltage 
 between the emitter and ground. (In this circuit, VE is zero.)
You can calculate a double-subscript voltage of different subscripts by 
subtracting its single-subscript voltages. Here are three examples:
VCE 5 VC 2 VE
VCB 5 VC 2 VB
VBE 5 VB 2 VE
This is how you could calculate the double-subscript voltages for any transistor 
 circuit: Since VE is zero in this CE connection (Fig. 6-7 b), the voltages simplify to:
VCE 5 VC
VCB 5 VC 2 VB
VBE 5 VB
6-5 The Base Curve
What do you think the graph of IB versus VBE looks like? It looks like the graph 
of an ordinary diode as shown in Fig. 6-8 a. And why not? This is a forward-
biased emitter diode, so we would expect to see the usual diode graph of current 
versus voltage. What this means is that we can use any of the diode approxima-
tions discussed earlier.GOOD TO KNOW
The “transistor” was first named 
by John Pierce while working at 
Bell Labs. This new device was 
to be a dual of the vacuum tube.  
The vacuum tube had “transcon-
ductance”, while the new 
device had “transresistance” 
characteristics.BJT Fundamentals  197Applying Ohm’s law to the base resistor of Fig. 6-8 b gives this  derivation:
IB 5   VBB 2 VBE  __________  RB   (6-6)
If you use an ideal diode, VBE 5 0. With the second approximation, VBE 5 0.7 V .
Most of the time, you will fi  nd the second approximation to be the best 
compromise between the speed of using the ideal diode and the accuracy of higher 
approximations. All you need to remember for the second approximation is that 
VBE is 0.7 V, as shown in Fig. 6-8 a.(a)

Example 6-4 
Use the second approximation to calculate the base current in Fig. 6-8 b. What is 
the voltage across the base resistor? The collector current if /H9252dc 5 200?
SOLUTION   The base source voltage of 2 V forward-biases the emitter diode 
through a current-limiting resistance of 100 k V. Since the emitter diode has 0.7 V 
across it, the voltage across the base resistor is:
VBB 2 VBE 5 2 V 2 0.7 V  5 1.3 V
The current through the base resistor is:
IB 5   VBB 2 VBE _________  
RB   5    1.3 V _______ 100 k V    5 13 /H9262A198 Chapter 66-6 Collector Curves
In Fig. 6-9 a, we already know how to calculate the base current. Since VBB
forward-biases the emitter diode, all we need to do is calculate the current through 
the base resistor RB. Now, let us turn our attention to the collector loop.
We can vary VBB and VCC in Fig. 6-9 a to produce different transistor 
 voltages and currents. By measuring IC and VCE, we can get data for a graph of IC
 versus VCE.
For instance, suppose we change VBB as needed to get IB 5 10 /H9262A. With 
this fi  xed value of base current, we can now vary VCC and measure IC and VCE. 
Plotting the data gives the graph shown in Fig. 6-9 b. (Note:  This graph is for a 
2N3904, a widely used low-power transistor. With other transistors, the numbers 
may vary but the shape of the curve will be similar.)
When VCE is zero, the collector diode is not reverse biased. This is why 
the graph shows a collector current of zero when VCE is zero. When VCE increases 
from zero, the collector current rises sharply in Fig. 6-9 b. When VCE is a few 
tenths of a volt, the collector current becomes almost constant  and equal to 1 mA.
With a current gain of 200, the collector current is:
IC 5 /H9252dcIB 5 (200)(13 /H9262A) 5 2.6 mA

VCE–+ –+Figure 6-9  (a) Basic transistor circuit; ( b) collector curve.BJT Fundamentals  199The constant-current region in Fig. 6-9 b is related to our earlier discus-
sions of transistor action. After the collector diode becomes reverse biased, it is 
gathering all the electrons that reach its depletion layer. Further increases in VCE
cannot increase the collector current. Why? Because the collector can collect only 
those free electrons that the emitter injects into the base. The number of these in-
jected electrons depends only on the base circuit, not on the collector circuit. This 
is why Fig. 6-9 b shows a constant collector current between a VCE of less than 1 V 
to a VCE of more than 40 V.
If VCE is greater than 40 V, the collector diode breaks down and normal 
transistor action is lost. The transistor is not intended to operate in the breakdown 
region. For this reason, one of the maximum ratings to look for on a transistor data 
sheet is the collector-emitter breakdown voltage VCE(max). If the transistor breaks 
down, it will be destroyed.
Collector Voltage and Power
Kirchhoff’s voltage law says that the sum of voltages around a loop or closed path 
is equal to zero. When applied to the collector circuit of Fig. 6-9 a, Kirchhoff’s 
voltage law gives us this derivation:
VCE 5 VCC 2 ICRC (6-7)
This says that the collector-emitter voltage equals the collector supply voltage 
minus the voltage across the collector resistor.
In Fig. 6-9 a, the transistor has a power dissipation of approximately:
PD 5 VCEIC (6-8)
This says that the transistor power equals the collector-emitter voltage times 
the collector current. This power dissipation causes the junction temperature 
of the collector diode to increase. The higher the power, the higher the junction 
 temperature.
Transistors will burn out when the junction temperature is between 150 
and 200°C. One of the most important pieces of information on a data sheet is the 
maximum power rating PD(max). The power dissipation given by Eq. (6-8) must be 
less than PD(max). Otherwise, the transistor will be destroyed.
Regions of Operation
The curve of Fig. 6-9 b has different regions where the action of a transistor 
changes. First, there is the region in the middle where VCE is between 1 and 40 V . 
This represents the normal operation of a transistor. In this region, the emitter 
diode is forward biased, and the collector diode is reverse biased. Furthermore, 
the collector is gathering almost all the electrons that the emitter has sent into 
the base. This is why changes in collector voltage have no effect on the collector 
current. This region is called the active region.  Graphically, the active region is 
the horizontal part of the curve. In other words, the collector current is constant
in this region.
Another region of operation is the breakdown region.  The transistor 
should never operate in this region because it will be destroyed. Unlike the zener 
diode, which is optimized for breakdown operation, a transistor is not intended for 
operation in the breakdown region.
Third, there is the early rising part of the curve, where VCE is between 
0 V and a few tenths of a volt. This sloping part of the curve is called the satura-
tion region. In this region, the collector diode has insuffi  cient positive voltage to 
collect all the free electrons injected into the base. In this region, the base current 
IB is larger than normal and the current gain /H9252dc is smaller than normal.200 Chapter 6More Curves
If we measure IC and VCE for IB 5 20 /H9262A, we can plot the second curve of Fig. 6-10. 
The curve is similar to the fi  rst curve, except that the collector current is 2 mA in the 
active region. Again, the collector current is constant in the active region.
When we plot several curves for different base currents, we get a set of 
collector curves like those in Fig. 6-10. Another way to get this set of curves is 
with a curve tracer  (a test instrument that can display IC versus VCE for a transis-
tor). In the active region of Fig. 6-10, each collector current is 100 times greater 
than the corresponding base current. For instance, the top curve has a collector 
current of 7 mA and a base current of 70 /H9262A. This gives a current gain of:
/H9252dc 5   IC __ IB   5   7 mA ______ 70 /H9262A   5 100
If you check any other curve, you get the same result: a current gain of 100.
With other transistors, the current gain may be different from 100, but 
the shape of the curves will be similar. All transistors have an active region, a sat-
uration region, and a breakdown region. The active region is the most important 
because amplifi  cation (enlargement) of signals is possible in the active region.
Cutoff   Region
Figure 6-10 has an unexpected curve, the one on the bottom. This represents a 
fourth possible region of operation. Notice that the base current is zero, but there 
still is a small collector current. On a curve tracer, this current is usually so small 
that you cannot see it. We have exaggerated the bottom curve by drawing it larger 
than usual. This bottom curve is called the cutoff region  of the transistor, and the 
small collector current is called the collector cutoff current.
Why does the collector cutoff current exist? Because the collector 
diode has reverse minority-carrier current and surface-leakage current. In a 
well- designed circuit, the collector cutoff current is small enough to ignore. For 
 instance, a 2N3904 has a collector cutoff current of 50 nA. If the actual collector 
current is 1 mA, ignoring a collector cutoff current of 50 nA produces a calcula-
tion error of less than 5 percent.1 V1

GOOD TO KNOW
When displayed on a curve 
tracer, the collector curves in 
Fig. 6-10 actually have a slight 
upward slope as VCE increases. 
This rise is the result of the 
base region becoming slightly 
smaller as VCE increases. 
(As VCE increases, the CB 
depletion layer widens, thus 
narrowing the base.) With a 
smaller base region, there 
are fewer holes available for 
recombination. Since each curve 
represents a constant base 
current, the effect looks like an 
increase in collector current.BJT Fundamentals  201Recap
A transistor has four distinct operating regions: active, cutoff, saturation,  and 
breakdown.  Transistors operate in the active region when they are used to amplify 
weak signals. Sometimes, the active region is called the linear region  because 
changes in the input signal produce proportional changes in the output signal. The 
saturation and cutoff regions are useful in digital and computer circuits, referred 
to as switching circuits.

Calculate the current gain of the 2N4424.BJT Fundamentals  2036-7 Transistor Approximations
Figure 6-13 a shows a transistor. A voltage VBE appears across the emitter diode, 
and a voltage VCE appears across the collector-emitter terminals. What is the 
equivalent circuit for this transistor?
Ideal Approximation
Figure 6-13 b shows the ideal approximation of a transistor. We visualize the emit-
ter diode as an ideal diode. In this case, VBE 5 0. This allows us to calculate base 
current quickly and easily. This equivalent circuit is often useful for troubleshoot-
ing when all we need is a rough approximation of base current.
As shown in Fig. 6-13 b, the collector side of the transistor acts like a cur-
rent source that pumps a collector current of /H9252dcIB through the collector resistor. 
Therefore, after you calculate the base current, you can multiply by the current 
gain to get the collector current.
The Second Approximation
Figure 6-13 c shows the second approximation of a transistor. This is more com-
monly used because it may improve the analysis signifi  cantly when the base- 
supply voltage is small.
This time, we use the second approximation of a diode when calculating 
base current. For silicon transistors, this means that VBE 5 0.7 V. (For germanium 
transistors, VBE 5 0.3 V.) With the second approximation, the base and collector 
currents will be slightly less than their ideal values.
SOLUTION  First, get the base current as follows:
IB 5   10 V 2 0.7 V  ____________  330 k V   5 28.2 /H9262A
Next, we need the collector current. Since the multimeter indicates a collector-
emitter voltage of 5.45 V (rounded to three places), the voltage across the collec-
tor resistor is:
V 5 10 V  2 5.45 V  5 4.55 V
Since the collector current fl  ows through the collector resistor, we can use Ohm’s 
law to get the collector current:
IC 5   4.55 V ______ 470 V   5 9.68 mA
Now, we can calculate the current gain:
/H9252dc 5   9.68 mA ________ 28.2 /H9262A   5 343
The 2N4424 is an example of a transistor with a high current gain. The typical 
range of /H9252dc for small-signal transistors is 100 to 300.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 6-6  Using Multisim, change the base resistor of 
Fig. 6-12 to 560 k V and calculate the current gain of the 2N4424.
GOOD TO KNOW
A bipolar transistor is frequently 
used as a constant current 
source.204 Chapter 6
Example 6-7
What is the collector-emitter voltage in Fig. 6-14? Use the ideal transistor.Higher Approximations
The bulk resistance of the emitter diode becomes important only in high-power 
applications in which the currents are large. The effect of bulk resistance in the 
emitter diode is to increase VBE to more than 0.7 V . For instance, in some high-
power circuits, the VBE across the base-emitter diode may be more than 1 V .
Likewise, the bulk resistance of the collector diode may have a noticea-
ble effect in some designs. Besides emitter and collector bulk resistances, a tran-
sistor has many other higher-order effects that make hand calculations tedious and 
time-consuming. For this reason, calculations beyond the second approximation 
should use a computer solution.–

SOLUTION   An ideal emitter diode means that:
VBE 5 0
Therefore, the total voltage across RB is 15 V. Ohm’s law tells us that:
IB 5   15 V _______ 470 k V   5 31.9 /H9262A
The collector current equals the current gain times the base current:
IC 5 100(31.9 /H9262A) 5 3.19 mA
Next, we calculate the collector-emitter voltage. It equals the collector supply 
voltage minus the voltage drop across the collector resistor:
VCE 5 15 V  2 (3.19 mA)(3.6 k V) 5 3.52 V
In a circuit like Fig. 6-14, knowing the value of the emitter current is not 
important, so most people would not calculate this quantity. But since this is an 
example, we will calculate the emitter current. It equals the sum of the  collector 
current and the base current:
IE 5 3.19 mA  1 31.9 /H9262A 5 3.22 mA
This value is extremely close to the value of the collector current, which is  another 
reason for not bothering to calculate it. Most people would say that the emitter 
current is approximately 3.19 mA, the value of the collector current.
Example 6-8 
What is the collector-emitter voltage in Fig. 6-14 if you use the second 
 approximation?
SOLUTION   In Fig. 6-14, here is how you would calculate the currents and 
voltages, using the second approximation. The voltage across the emitter diode is:
VBE 5 0.7 V
Therefore, the total voltage across RB is 14.3 V, the difference between 15 and 
0.7 V. The base current is:
IB 5   14.3 V _______ 470 k V   5 30.4 /H9262A
The collector current equals the current gain times the base current:
IC 5 100(30.4 /H9262A) 5 3.04 mA
The collector-emitter voltage equals:
VCE 5 15 V  2 (3.04 mA)(3.6 k V) 5 4.06 V
The improvement in this answer over the ideal answer is about half a 
volt: 4.06 versus 3.52 V. Is this half a volt important? It depends on whether you 
are troubleshooting, designing, and so on.206 Chapter 6
Example 6-9
Suppose you measure a VBE of 1 V. What is the collector-emitter voltage in Fig. 6-14?
SOLUTION   The total voltage across RB is 14 V , the difference between 15 and 1 V . Ohm’s law tells us that the base 
current is:
 IB 5    14 V _______ 470 k V    5 29.8 /H9262A
The collector current equals the current gain times the base current:
 IC 5 100(29.8 /H9262A) 5 2.98 mA
The collector-emitter voltage equals:
VCE 5 15 V  2 (2.98 mA)(3.6 k V) 5 4.27 V
Example 6-10
What is the collector-emitter voltage in the three preceding examples if the base supply voltage is 5 V?
SOLUTION   With the ideal diode:
 IB 5   5 V _______ 470 k V   5 10.6 /H9262A
 I C 5 100(10.6 /H9262A) 5 1.06 mA
VCE 5 15 V  2 (1.06 mA)(3.6 k V) 5 11.2 V
With the second approximation:
 I B 5   4.3 V _______ 470 k V   5 9.15 /H9262A 
 I C 5 100(9.15 /H9262A) 5 0.915 mA
VCE 5 15 V  2 (0.915 mA)(3.6 k V) 5 11.7 V
With the measured VBE: 
 I B 5   4 V _______ 470 k V   5 8.51 /H9262A
 IC 5 100(8.51 /H9262A) 5 0.851 mA
VCE 5 15 V  2 (0.851 mA)(3.6 k V) 5 11.9 V
This example allows you to compare the three approximations for the case of low base supply voltage. As you 
can see, all answers are within a volt of each other. This is the fi  rst clue as to which approximation to use. If you are 
 troubleshooting this circuit, the ideal analysis will probably be adequate. But if you are designing the circuit, you might 
want to use a computer solution because of its accuracy. Summary Table 6-1 illustrates the difference between the ideal and 
second transistor approximations.

6-8 Reading Data Sheets
Small-signal transistors  can dissipate less than a watt; power transistors  can 
 dissipate more than a watt. When you look at a data sheet for either type of tran-
sistor, you should start with the maximum ratings because these are the limits on 
the transistor currents, voltages, and other quantities.
Breakdown Ratings
In the data sheet shown in Fig. 6-15, the following maximum ratings of a 2N3904 
are given:
VCEO 40 V
VCBO 60 V
VEBO  6 V
These voltage ratings are reverse breakdown voltages, and VCEO is the voltage 
 between the collector and the emitter with the base open. The second rating is 
VCBO, which stands for the voltage from collector to base with the emitter open.  
Likewise, VEBO is the maximum reverse voltage from emitter to base with the 
collector open. As usual, a conservative design never allows voltages to get even 
close to the foregoing maximum ratings. If you recall, even getting close to max-
imum ratings can shorten the lifetime of some devices.RBRC

Figure 6-15( b)  (continued)210 Chapter 6Maximum Current and Power
Also shown in the data sheet are these values:
IC 200 mA
PD 625 mW
Here, IC is the maximum dc collector current rating. This means that a 2N3904 can 
handle up to 200 mA of direct current, provided the power rating is not exceeded. 
The next rating, PD, is the maximum power rating of the device. This power  rating 
depends on whether any attempt is being made to keep the transistor cool. If the 
transistor is not being fan-cooled and does not have a heat sink (discussed next), its 
case temperature TC will be much higher than the ambient temperature TA.
In most applications, a small-signal transistor like the 2N3904 is not fan-
cooled and it does not have a heat sink. In this case, the 2N3904 has a power  rating 
of 625 mW when the ambient temperature TA is 25°C.
The case temperature TC is the temperature of the transistor package 
or housing. In most applications, the case temperature will be higher than 25°C 
 because the internal heat of the transistor increases the case temperature.
The only way to keep the case temperature at 25°C when the ambient 
temperature is 25°C is by fan-cooling or by using a large heat sink. If fan cooling 
or a large heat sink is used, it is possible to reduce the temperature of the transistor 
case to 25°C. For this condition, the power rating can be increased to 1.5 W.
Derating Factors
What is the importance of a derating factor? The derating factor tells you how 
much you have to  reduce the power rating of a device. The derating factor of the 
2N3904 is given as 5 mW/°C. This means that you have to reduce the power rating 
of 625 mW by 5 mW for each degree above 25°C.
Heat Sinks
One way to increase the power rating of a transistor is to get rid of the internal 
heat faster. This is the purpose of a heat sink  (a mass of metal). If we increase the 
surface area of the transistor case, we allow the heat to escape more easily into 
the surrounding air. For instance, Fig. 6-16 a shows one type of heat sink. When 
this is pushed onto the transistor case, heat radiates more quickly because of the 
increased surface area of the fi  ns.
Figure 6-16 b shows another approach. This is the outline of a power-tab 
transistor. A metal tab provides a path out of the transistor for heat. This metal tab 
can be fastened to the chassis of electronic equipment. Because the chassis is a 
massive heat sink, heat can easily escape from the transistor to the chassis.
Large power transistors like Fig. 6-16 c have the collector connected 
to the case to let heat escape as easily as possible. The transistor case is then 
fastened to the chassis. To prevent the collector from shorting to chassis ground, 
a thin insulating washer and heat-conducting compound is used between the 
transistor case and the chassis. The important idea here is that heat can leave 
the transistor more rapidly, which means that the transistor has a higher power 
rating at the same ambient temperature. Sometimes, the transistor is fastened to 
a large heat sink with fi  ns; this is even more effi  cient in removing heat from the 
transistor. In Fig. 6-16 c, the case outline displays the base and emitter leads, as 
viewed from the bottom of the transistor (leads pointing at you). Notice that the 
base and emitter leads are offset from the center of the case.
No matter what kind of heat sink is used, the purpose is to lower the case 
temperature because this will lower the internal or junction temperature of the 
transistor. The data sheet includes other quantities called thermal resistances.  
These allow a designer to work out the case temperature for different heat sinks.(a)

Current Gain
In another system of analysis called h parameters,  hFE rather than /H9252dc is defi  ned 
as the symbol for current gain. The two quantities are equal:
/H9252dc 5 hFE (6-9)
Remember this relation because data sheets use the symbol hFE for the current gain.
In the section labeled “On Characteristics,” the data sheet of a 2N3904 
lists the values of hFE as follows:
IC, mA Min. hFE Max. hFE
  0.1  40 —
 1  70 —
 10 100 300
 50  60 —
100  30 —
The 2N3904 works best when the collector current is in the vicinity of 10 mA. At 
this level of current, the minimum current gain is 100 and the maximum current 
gain is 300. What does this mean? It means that if you mass-produce a circuit 
using 2N3904s and a collector current of 10 mA, some of the transistors will have 
a current gain as low as 100, and some will have a current gain as high as 300. 
Most of the transistors will have a current gain in the middle of this range.
Notice how the minimum current gain decreases for collector currents 
that are less than or greater than 10 mA. At 0.1 mA, the minimum current gain is 
40. At 100 mA, the minimum current gain is 30. The data sheet shows only the 
minimum current gain for currents different from 10 mA because the minimum 
values represent the worst case. Designers usually do worst-case design; that is, 
they fi  gure out how the circuit will work when the transistor characteristics such 
as current gain are at their worst case.
Example 6-11
A 2N3904 has VCE 5 10 V and IC 5 20 mA. What is the power dissipation? How 
safe is this level of power dissipation if the ambient temperature is 25°C?
SOLUTION   Multiply VCE by IC to get:
PD 5 (10 V)(20 mA)  5 200 mW
Is this safe? If the ambient temperature is 25°C, the transistor has a power rating 
of 625 mW. This means that the transistor is well within its power rating.
As you know, a good design includes a safety factor to ensure a longer 
operating life for the transistor. Safety factors of 2 or more are common. A 
safety factor of 2 means that the designer would allow up to half of 625 mW, 
or 312 mW. Therefore, a power of only 200 mW is very conservative, provided 
the ambient temperature stays at 25°C.212 Chapter 66-9 Surface-Mount Transistors
Surface-mount transistors are usually found in a simple three-terminal, gull-wing 
package. The SOT-23 package is the smaller of the two and is used for transistors 
rated in the milliwatt range. The SOT-223 is the larger package and is used when 
the power rating is about 1 W.
Figure 6-17 shows a typical SOT-23 package. Viewed from the top, the 
terminals are numbered in a counterclockwise direction, with terminal 3 the lone 
terminal on one side. The terminal assignments are fairly well standardized for 
bipolar transistors: 1 is the base, 2 is the emitter, and 3 is the collector. 
Example 6-12
How safe is the level of power dissipation if the ambient temperature is 100°C in 
Example 6-11?
SOLUTION   First, work out the number of degrees that the new ambient 
 temperature is above the reference temperature of 25°C. Do this as follows:
100°C  2 25°C  5 75°C
Sometimes, you will see this written as:
DT 5 75°C
where D stands for “difference in.” Read the equation as the difference in 
 temperature equals 75°C.
Now, multiply the derating factor by the difference in temperature to get:
(5 mW/°C)(75°C)  5 375 mW
You often see this written as:
DP 5 375 mW
where DP stands for the difference in power. Finally, you subtract the difference 
in power from the power rating at 25°C:
PD(max) 5 625 mW  2 375 mW  5 250 mW
This is the power rating of the transistor when the ambient temperature is 100°C.
How safe is this design? The transistor is still all right because its power 
is 200 mW compared with the maximum rating of 250 mW. But we no longer 
have a safety factor of 2. If the ambient temperature were to increase further, or 
if the power dissipation were to increase, the transistor could get dangerously 
close to the burnout point. Because of this, a designer might redesign the circuit 
to restore the safety factor of 2. This means changing circuit values to get a power 
dissipation of half of 250 mW, or 125 mW.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 6-12   Using a safety factor of 2, could you safely 
use the 2N3904 transistor of Example 6-12 if the ambient temperature were 75°C?BJT Fundamentals  213The SOT-223 package is designed to dissipate the heat generated by 
transistors operating in the 1-W range. This package has a larger surface area 
than the SOT-23; this increases its ability to dissipate heat. Some of the heat is 
dissipated from the top surface, and much is carried away by the contact between 
the device and the circuit board below. The special feature of the SOT-223 case, 
however, is the extra collector tab that extends from the side opposite the main 
terminals. The bottom view in Fig. 6-18 shows that the two collector terminals 
are electrically identical.
The standard terminal assignments are different for the SOT-23 and 
SOT-223 packages. The three terminals located on one edge are numbered in 
sequence, from left to right as viewed from the top. Terminal 1 is the base, 2 is the 
collector (electrically identical to the large tab at the opposite edge), and 3 is the 
emitter. Looking back at Fig. 6-15, note that the 2N3904 comes in two 
 surface-mount packages. The MMBT3904 is an SOT-23 package with a maxi-
mum power dissipation of 350 mW, while the PZT3904 is an SOT-223 package 
with a power dissipation rating of 1000 mW.
The SOT-23 packages are too small to have any standard part identifi  -
cation codes printed on them. Usually, the only way to determine the standard 
identifi  er is by noting the part number printed on the circuit board and then con-
sulting the parts list for the circuit. SOT-223 packages are large enough to have 
identifi  cation codes printed on them, but these codes are rarely standard transistor 
identifi  cation codes. The typical procedure for learning more about a transistor in 
an SOT-223 package is the same as for the smaller SOT-23 confi  gurations.
Occasionally, a circuit uses SOIC packages that house multiple transis-
tors. The SOIC package resembles the tiny dual-inline package commonly used 
for ICs and the older feed-through circuit board technology. The terminals on the 
SOIC, however, have the gull-wing shape required for SM technology.EMITTERCOLLECTOR

The current gain /H9252dc of a transistor depends on three factors: the transistor, the 
collector current, and the temperature. For instance, when you replace a transistor 
with another of the same type, the current gain usually changes. Likewise, if the 
collector current or temperature changes, the current gain will change.
Worst and Best Case
As a concrete example, the data sheet of a 2N3904 lists a minimum hFE of 100 
and a maximum of 300 when the temperature is 25°C and the collector current is 
10 mA. If we build thousands of circuits with 2N3904s, some of the transistors 
will have a current gain as low as 100 (worst case), and others will have a current 
gain as high as 300 (best case).
Figure 6-19 shows the graphs of a 2N3904 for the worst case (minimum 
hFE). Look at the middle curve, the current gain for an ambient temperature of 
25°C. When the collector current is 10 mA, the current gain is 100, the worst 
case for a 2N3904. (In the best case, a few 2N3904s have a current gain of 300 at 
10 mA and 25°C.)
Eff  ect of Current and Temperature
When the temperature is 25°C (the middle curve), the current gain is 50 at 
0.1 mA. As the current increases from 0.1 mA to 10 mA, hFE increases to a max-
imum of 100. Then, it decreases to less than 20 at 200 mA.
Also notice the effect of temperature. When the temperature decreases, 
the current gain is less (the bottom curve). On the other hand, when the tempera-
ture increases, hFE increases over most of the current range (the top curve).
Main Idea
As you can see, transistor replacement, collector-current changes, or temperature 
changes can produce large changes in hFE or /H9252dc. At a given temperature, a 3 ;1 
change is possible when a transistor is replaced. When the temperature varies, an 
additional 3 ;1 variation is possible. And when the current varies, more than a 3 ;1 
variation is possible. In summary, the 2N3904 may have a current gain of less than 
10 to more than 300. Because of this, any design that depends on a precise value 
of current gain will fail in mass production.GOOD TO KNOW

In order for a transistor to function as an amplifi  er or a switch, it must fi  rst have 
its dc circuit conditions set properly. This is referred to as properly biasing the 
transistor. Various biasing methods are possible, with each having advantages and 
disadvantages. In this chapter, we will begin with base bias.  
Base Bias
The circuit of Fig. 6-20 a is an example of base bias,  which means setting up 
a fi  xed value of base current.  For instance, if RB 5 1 MV, the base current is 
14.3 /H9262A (second approximation). Even with transistor replacements and temper-
ature changes, the base current remains fi  xed at approximately 14.3 /H9262A under all 
operating conditions.
If /H9252dc 5 100 in Fig. 6-20 a, the collector current is approximately 1.43 mA 
and the collector-emitter voltage is:
VCE 5 VCC 2 ICRC 5 15 V 2 (1.43 mA)(3 k V) 5 10.7 V
Therefore, the quiescent, or Q, point in Fig. 6-20 a is:
IC 5 1.43 mA     and    VCE 5 10.7 V
Graphical Solution
We can also fi  nd the Q point using a graphical solution based on the transistor 
load line,  a graph of IC versus VCE. In Fig. 6-20 a, the collector-emitter voltage is 
given by:
VCE 5 VCC 2 ICRC
Solving for IC gives:
IC 5   VCC 2 VCE __________  RC   (6-10)
If we graph this equation ( IC versus VCE), we will get a straight line. This line is 
called the load line  because it represents the effect of the load on IC and VCE.
For instance, substituting the values of Fig. 6-20 a into Eq. (6-10) gives:

equation  is any equation that can be reduced to the standard form of y 5 mx 1 b.) 
If we graph the foregoing equation on top of the collector curves, we get Fig. 6-20 b.
The ends of the load line are the easiest to fi  nd. When VCE 5 0 in the 
load-line equation (the foregoing equation):
IC 5   15 V _____ 3 kV   5 5 mA
The values, IC 5 5 mA and VCE 5 0, plot as the upper end of the load line in 
Fig. 6-20 b.
When IC 5 0, the load-line equation gives:
0 5   15 V 2 VCE __________  3 kV  
or
VCE 5 15 V
The coordinates, IC 5 0 and VCE 5 15 V , plot as the lower end of the load line in 
Fig. 6-20 b.
Visual Summary of All Operating Points
Why is the load line useful? Because it contains every possible operating point 
for the circuit. Stated another way, when the base resistance varies from zero to 
infi nity, it causes IB to vary, which makes IC and VCE vary over their entire ranges. 
If you plot the IC and VCE values for every possible IB value, you will get the 
load line. Therefore, the load line is a visual summary of all possible transistor 
 operating points .
The Saturation Point
When the base resistance is too small, there is too much collector current, and the 
collector-emitter voltage drops to approximately zero. In this case, the transistor 
goes into saturation.  This means that the collector current has increased to its 
maximum possible value.
The saturation point  is the point in Fig. 6-20 b where the load line inter-
sects the saturation region of the collector curves. Because the collector-emitter 
voltage VCE at saturation is very small, the saturation point is almost touching the 
upper end of the load line. From now on, we will approximate the saturation point 
as the upper end of the load line, bearing in mind that there is a slight error.
The saturation point tells you the maximum possible collector current 
for the circuit. For instance, the transistor of Fig. 6-21 a goes into saturation when 
the collector current is approximately 5 mA. At this current, VCE has decreased to 
 approximately z ero.
There is an easy way to fi  nd the current at the saturation point. Visualize 
a short between the collector and emitter to get Fig. 6-21 b. Then VCE drops to 
zero. All the 15 V from the collector supply will be across the 3 k V. Therefore, 
the  current is:
IC 5   15 V _____ 3 kV   5 5 mA
You can apply this “mental short” method to any base-biased circuit.
Here is the formula for the saturation current in base-biased circuits:
IC(sat) 5   VCC ____ RC   (6-11)GOOD TO KNOW
When a transistor is saturated, 
further increases in base current 
produce no further increases in 
collector current.BJT Fundamentals  217This says that the maximum value of the collector current equals the collector sup-
ply voltage divided by the collector resistance. It is nothing more than Ohm’s law 
applied to the collector resistor. Figure 6-21 b is a visual reminder of this equation.
The Cutoff   Point
The cutoff point  is the point at which the load line intersects the cutoff region of 
the collector curves in Fig. 6-20 b. Because the collector current at cutoff is very 
small, the cutoff point almost touches the lower end of the load line. From now on, 
we will approximate the cutoff point as the lower end of the load line.
The cutoff point tells you the maximum possible collector-emitter volt-
age for the circuit. In Fig. 6-21 a, the maximum possible VCE is approximately 
15 V, the collector supply voltage.
There is a simple process for fi  nding the cutoff voltage. Visualize the tran-
sistor of Fig. 6-21 a as an open between the collector and the emitter (see Fig. 6-21 c). 
Since there is no current through the collector resistor for this open condition, all the 
15 V from the collector supply will appear between the collector-emitter terminals. 
Therefore, the voltage between the collector and the emitter will equal 15 V:

Every transistor circuit has a load line. Given any circuit, work out the saturation 
current and the cutoff voltage. These values are plotted on the vertical and hori-
zontal axes. Then draw a line through these two points to get the load line.
Plotting the Q Point
Figure 6-24 a shows a base-biased circuit with a base resistance of 500 k V. We get 
the saturation current and cutoff voltage by the process given earlier. First, visu-
alize a short across the collector-emitter terminals. Then all the collector supply 
voltage appears across the collector resistor, which means that the saturation cur-
rent is 5 mA. Second, visualize the collector-emitter terminals open. Then there is 
no current, and all the supply voltage appears across the collector-emitter termi-
nals, which means that the cutoff voltage is 15 V . If we plot the saturation current 
and cutoff voltage, we can draw the load line shown in Fig. 6-24 b.

Figure 6-23 c shows the two load lines. Changing the collector resistor with the same collector supply voltage 
produces load lines of different slopes but the same cutoff values. Also, notice that a smaller collector resistance produces 
a larger slope (steeper or closer to vertical). This happens because the slope of the load line is equal to the reciprocal of t he 
collector resistance:

sistor. This means that all the base supply voltage will appear across the base 
re sistor. Therefore, the base current is:
IB 5   15 V _______ 500 k V   5 30 /H9262A
We cannot proceed until we have a value for the current gain. Suppose 
the current gain of the transistor is 100. Then the collector current is:
IC 5 100(30 /H9262A) 5 3 mA
This current fl  owing through 3 k V produces a voltage of 9 V across the collec-
tor resistor. When we subtract this from the collector supply voltage, we get the 
 voltage across the transistor. Here are the calculations:
VCE 5 15 V  2 (3 mA)(3 k V) 5 6 V
By plotting 3 mA and 6 V (the collector current and voltage), we get the operat-
ing point shown on the load line of Fig. 6-24 b. The operating point is labeled Q 
 because this point is often called the quiescent point.  (Quiescent  means quiet, 
still, or resting.)
Why the Q Point Varies
We assumed a current gain of 100. What happens if the current gain is 50? If it is 
150? To begin, the base current remains the same because the current gain has no 
effect on the base current. Ideally, the base current is fi  xed at 30 /H9262A. When the 
current gain is 50:
IC 5 50(30 /H9262A) 5 1.5 mA
and the collector-emitter voltage is:
VCE 5 15 V  2 (1.5 mA)(3 k V) 5 10.5 V
plotting the values gives the low point QL shown in Fig. 6-24 b.
If the current gain is 150, then:
IC 5 150(30 /H9262A) 5 4.5 mA
and the collector-emitter voltage is:
VCE 5 15 V  2 (4.5 mA)(3 k V) 5 1.5 V
plotting these values gives the high point QH point shown in Fig. 6-24 b.
The three Q points of Fig. 6-24 b illustrate how sensitive the operating 
point of a base-biased transistor is to changes in /H9252dc. When the current gain varies 
from 50 to 150, the collector current changes from 1.5 to 4.5 mA. If the changes 
in current gain were much greater, the operating point could be driven easily 
into saturation or cutoff. In this case, an amplifying circuit would become useless 
 because of the loss of current gain outside the active region.
The Formulas
The formulas for calculating the Q point are as follows:
IB 5   VBB 2 VBE __________  RB   (6-13)
IC 5 bdcIB (6-14)
VCE 5 VCC 2 ICRC (6-15)GOOD TO KNOW
Because the values of IC and 
VCE are dependent on the val-
ues of beta in a base-biased 
circuit, the circuit is said to be 
beta-dependent.222 Chapter 66-13  Recognizing Saturation
There are two basic kinds of transistor circuits: amplifying  and switching.  With 
amplifying circuits, the Q point must remain in the active region under all operat-
ing conditions. If it does not, the output signal will be distorted on the peak where 
saturation or cutoff occurs. With switching circuits, the Q point usually switches 
between saturation and cutoff. How switching circuits work, what they do, and 
why they are used will be discussed later.
Impossible Answers
Assume that the transistor of Fig. 6-25 a has a breakdown voltage greater than 
20 V . Then, we know that it is not operating in the breakdown region. Further-
more, we can tell at a glance that the transistor is not operating in the cutoff re-
gion because of the biasing voltages. What is not immediately clear, however, is 
whether the transistor is operating in the active region or the saturation region. It 
must be  operating in one of these regions. But which?

SOLUTION   Ideally, the base current would decrease to 15 /H9262A, the collec-
tor current would decrease to 1.5 mA, and the collector-emitter voltage would 
 increase to:
VCE 5 15 2 (1.5 mA)(3 k V) 5 10.5 V
To a second approximation, the base current would decrease to 14.3 /H9262A,
and the collector current would decrease to 1.43 mA. The collector-emitter 
 voltage would increase to:
VCE 5 15 2 (1.43 mA)(3 k V) 5 10.7 V
PRACTICE PROBLEM 6-17   If the /H9252dc value of Example 6-17 changed to 
150 due to a temperature change, fi  nd the new value of VCE.BJT Fundamentals  223Troubleshooters and designers often use the following method to deter-
mine whether a transistor is operating in the active region or the saturation region. 
Here are the steps:
1. Assume that the transistor is operating in the active region.
2. Carry out the calculations for currents and voltages.
3. If an impossible result occurs in any calculation, the assumption is 
false.
An impossible answer means that the transistor is saturated. Otherwise, the tran-
sistor is operating in the active region.
Saturation-Current Method
For instance, Fig. 6-25 a shows a base-biased circuit. Start by calculating the sat-
uration current:
IC(sat) 5   20 V ______ 10 kV   5 2 mA
The base current is ideally 0.1 mA. Assuming a current gain of 50 as shown, the 
collector current is:
IC 5 50(0.1 mA)  5 5 mA
The answer is impossible because the collector current cannot be greater than 
the saturation current. Therefore, the transistor cannot be operating in the active 
 region; it must be operating in the saturation region.
Collector-Voltage Method
Suppose you want to calculate VCE in Fig. 6-25 a. Then you can proceed like this: 
The base current is ideally 0.1 mA. Assuming a current gain of 50 as shown, the 
collector current is:
IC 5 50(0.1 mA)  5 5 mA
and the collector-emitter voltage is:
VCE 5 20 V  2 (5 mA)(10 k V) 5 2 30 V
This result is impossible because the collector-emitter voltage cannot be negative. 
So the transistor cannot be operating in the active region; it must be operating in 
the saturation region.
Current Gain Is Less in Saturation Region
When you are given the current gain, it is usually for the active region. For 
 instance, the current gain of Fig. 6-25 a is shown as 50. This means that the collec-
tor current will be 50 times the base current, provided the transistor is operating 
in the active region.
When a transistor is saturated, the current gain is less than the current 
gain in the active region. You can calculate the saturated current gain as follows:
/H9252dc(sat)  5   IC(sat) _____ IB  
In Fig. 6-25 a, the saturated current gain is
/H9252dc(sat)  5   2 mA _______ 0.1 mA   5 20224 Chapter 6Hard Saturation
A designer who wants a transistor to operate in the saturation region under all 
conditions often selects a base resistance that produces a current gain of 10. 
This is called hard saturation,  because there is more than enough base current 
to saturate the transistor. For example, a base resistance of 50 k V in Fig. 6-25 a 
will produce a current gain of:
/H9252dc 5   2 mA _______ 0.2 mA   5 10
For the transistor in Fig. 6-25 a, it takes only
IB 5   2 mA _____ 50   5 0.04 mA
to saturate the transistor. Therefore, a base current of 0.2 mA will drive the tran-
sistor deep into saturation.
Why does a designer use hard saturation? Recall that the current gain 
changes with collector current, temperature variation, and transistor replacement. 
To make sure that the transistor does not slip out of saturation at low collector 
currents, low temperatures, and so on, the designer uses hard saturation to ensure 
transistor saturation under all operating conditions.
From now on, hard saturation  will refer to any design that makes the 
saturated current gain approximately 10. Soft saturation  will refer to any design 
in which the transistor is barely saturated, that is, in which the saturated current 
gain is only a little less than the active current gain.
Recognizing Hard Saturation at a Glance
Here is how you can quickly tell whether a transistor is in hard saturation. Often, 
the base supply voltage and the collector supply voltage are equal: VBB 5 VCC. 
When this is the case, a designer will use the 10 ;1 rule, which says to make the 
base resistance approximately 10 times as large as the collector resistance.
Figure 6-26 a was designed by using the 10 ;1 rule. Therefore, when-
ever  you see a circuit with a 10 ;1 ratio ( RB to RC), you can expect it to be  
saturated.

Base bias is useful in digital circuits  because these circuits are usually designed to 
operate at saturation and cutoff. Because of this, they have either low output volt-
age or high output voltage. In other words, none of the Q points between saturation 
Example 6-18
Suppose the base resistance of Fig. 6-25 a is increased to 1 M V. Is the transistor 
still saturated?
SOLUTION   Assume the transistor is operating in the active region, and 
see whether a contradiction arises. Ideally, the base current is 10 V divided by 
1 MV, or 10 /H9262A. The collector current is 50 times 10 /H9262A, or 0.5 mA. This current 
 produces 5 V across the collector resistor. Subtract 5 from 20 V to get:
VCE 5 15 V
There is no contradiction here. If the transistor were saturated, we would have 
calculated a negative number or, at most, 0 V. Because we got 15 V, we know that 
the transistor is operating in the active region.
Example 6-19
Suppose the collector resistance of Fig. 6-25 a is decreased to 5 k V. Does the 
transistor remain in the saturation region?
SOLUTION   Assume the transistor is operating in the active region, and see 
whether a contradiction arises. We can use the same approach as in Example 6-18, 
but for variety, let us try the second method.
Start by calculating the saturation value of the collector current. Visual-
ize a short between the collector and the emitter. Then you can see that 20 V will 
be across 5 k V. This gives a saturated collector current of:
IC(sat) 5 4 mA
The base current is ideally 10 V divided by 100 k V, or 0.1 mA. The collector 
current is 50 times 0.1 mA, or 5 mA.
There is a contradiction. The collector current cannot be greater than 
4 mA because the transistor saturates when IC 5 4 mA. The only thing that can 
change at this point is the current gain. The base current is still 0.1 mA, but the 
current gain decreases to:
/H9252dc(sat)  5   4 mA _______ 0.1 mA   5 40
This reinforces the idea discussed earlier. A transistor has two current 
gains, one in the active region and another in the saturation region. The second is 
equal to or smaller than the fi  rst.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 6-19   If the collector resistance of Fig. 6-25 a is 
4.7 k V, what value of base resistor would produce hard saturation using the 10 :1 
design rule?226 Chapter 6and cutoff are used. For this reason, variations in the Q point don’t matter because 
the transistor remains in saturation or cutoff when the current gain changes.
Here is an example of using a base-biased circuit to switch between sat-
uration and cutoff. Figure 6-26 a shows an example of a transistor in hard satura-
tion. Therefore, the output voltage is approximately 0 V. This means the Q point 
is at the upper end of the load line (Fig. 6-26 b).
When the switch opens, the base current drops to zero. Because of this, 
the collector current drops to zero. With no current through the 1 k V, all the 
collector supply voltage will appear across the collector-emitter terminals. There-
fore, the output voltage rises to 110 V. Now, the Q point is at the lower end of 
load line (see Fig. 6-26 b).
The circuit can have only two output voltages: 0 or 110 V. This is how 
you can recognize a digital circuit. It has only two output levels: low or high. The 
exact values of the two output voltages are not important. All that matters is that 
you can distinguish the voltages as low or high.
Digital circuits are often called switching circuits  because their Q point 
switches between two points on the load line. In most designs, the two points are 
saturation and cutoff. Another name often used is two-state circuits,  referring to 
the low and high outputs.
Example 6-20
The collector supply voltage of Fig. 6-26 a is decreased to 5 V. What are the two 
values of the output voltage? If the saturation voltage VCE(sat) is 0.15 V and the 
collector leakage current ICEO is 50 nA, what are the two values of the output 
voltage?
SOLUTION   The transistor switches between saturation and cutoff. Ideally, 
the two values of output voltage are 0 and 5 V . The fi  rst voltage is the voltage 
across the saturated transistor, and the second voltage is the voltage across the 
cutoff transistor.
If you include the effects of saturation voltage and collector leakage cur-
rent, the output voltages are 0.15 and 5 V. The fi  rst voltage is the voltage across 
the saturated transistor, which is given as 0.15 V. The second voltage is the col-
lector-emitter voltage with 50 nA fl  owing through 1 k V:
VCE 5 5 V 2 (50 nA)(1 k V) 5 4.99995 V
which rounds to 5 V.
Unless you are a designer, it is a waste of time to include the saturation 
voltage and the leakage current in your calculations of switching circuits. With 
switching circuits, all you need is two distinct voltages: one low and the other 
high. It doesn’t matter whether the low voltage is 0, 0.1, 0.15 V, and so on. Like-
wise, it doesn’t matter whether the high voltage is 5, 4.9, or 4.5 V. All that usually 
matters in the analysis of switching circuits is that you can distinguish the low 
voltage from the high voltage.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 6-20   If the circuit in Fig. 6-26 a used 12 V for 
its collector and base supply voltage, what are the two values of switched output 
voltage? ( VCE(sat) 5 0.15 V and ICEO 5 50 nA)BJT Fundamentals  2276-15  Troubleshooting
Figure 6-27 shows a common-emitter circuit with grounds. A base supply of 15 V 
forward-biases the emitter diode through a resistance of 470 k V. A collector sup-
ply of 15 V reverse-biases the collector diode through a resistance of 1 k V. Let us 
use the ideal approximation to fi  nd the collector-emitter voltage. The calculations 
are as follows:
 I B 5   15 V _______ 470 k V   5 31.9 /H9262A
 I C 5 100(31.9 /H9262A) 5 3.19 mA
VCE 5 15 V  2 (3.19 mA)(1 k V) 5 11.8 V
Common Troubles
If you are troubleshooting a circuit like Fig. 6-27, one of the fi  rst things to meas-
ure is the collector-emitter voltage. It should have a value in the vicinity of 11.8 V . 
Why don’t we use the second or third approximation to get a more accurate 
 answer? Because resistors usually have a tolerance of at least 65 percent, which 
causes the collector-emitter voltage to differ from your calculations, no matter 
what approximation you use.
In fact, when troubles come, they are usually big troubles like shorts or 
opens. Shorts may occur because of damaged devices or solder splashes across 
resistors. Opens may occur when components burn out. Troubles like these pro-
duce big changes in currents and voltages. For instance, one of the most common 
troubles occurs when no supply voltage reaches the collector. This could happen 
in a number of ways, such as a trouble in the power supply itself, an open lead 
 between the power supply and the collector resistor, an open collector resistor, 
and so on. In any of these cases, the collector voltage of Fig. 6-27 will be approx-
imately zero because there is no collector supply voltage.
Another possible trouble is an open base resistor, which drops the 
base current to zero. This forces the collector current to drop to zero and the 
 collector-emitter voltage to rise to 15 V, the value of the collector supply voltage. 
An open transistor has the same effect.
How Troubleshooters Think
The point is this: Typical troubles cause big deviations in transistor currents and 
voltages. Troubleshooters are seldom looking for differences in tenths of a volt. 
They are looking for voltages that are radically different from the ideal values.

–+–+228 Chapter 6This is why the ideal transistor is useful as a starting point in troubleshooting. 
 Furthermore, it explains why many troubleshooters don’t even use calculators to 
fi  nd the collector-emitter voltage.
If they don’t use calculators, what do they do? They mentally estimate 
the value of the collector-emitter voltage. Here is the thinking of an experienced 
troubleshooter while estimating the collector-emitter voltage in Fig. 6-27.
The voltage across the base resistor is about 15 V . A base resistance of 
1 MV would produce a base current of about 15 /H9262A. Since 470 k V is 
half of 1 M V, the base current is twice as much, approximately 30 /H9262A. 
A current gain of 100 gives a collector current of about 3 mA. When this 
ﬂ  ows through 1 k V, it produces a voltage drop of 3 V . Subtracting 3 V 
from 15 V leaves 12 V across the collector-emitter terminals. So, V CE 
should measure in the vicinity of 12 V , or else there is something wrong 
in this circuit.
A Table of Troubles
A shorted component is equivalent to a resistance of zero, whereas an open com-
ponent is equivalent to a resistance of infi  nity. For instance, the base resistor RB 
may be shorted or open. Let us designate these troubles by RBS and RBO. Similarly, 
the collector resistor may be shorted or open, symbolized by RCS and RCO.
Summary Table 6-2 shows a few of the troubles that could occur in a cir-
cuit like Fig. 6-27. The voltages were calculated using the second approximation. 
When the circuit is operating normally, you should measure a collector voltage 
of  approximately 12 V. If the base resistor were shorted, 115 V would appear at 
the base. This large voltage would destroy the emitter diode. The collector diode 
would probably open as a result, forcing the collector voltage to go to 15 V. The 
trouble RBS and its voltages are shown in Summary Table 6-2.
If the base resistor were open, there would be no base voltage or cur-
rent. Furthermore, the collector current would be zero, and the collector voltage 
would increase to 15 V. The trouble RBO and its voltages are shown in Summary 
Table 6-2. Continuing like this, we can get the remaining entries of the table.Summary Table 6-2 Troubles and Symptoms

exceeding any of the breakdown voltages, maximum currents, or power ratings 
can damage either or both diodes. The troubles may include shorts, opens, high 
leakage currents, and reduced /H9252dc.
Out-of-Circuit Tests
A transistor is commonly tested using a DMM set to the diode test range. 
Figure  6-28 shows how an npn transistor resembles two back-to-back diodes. 
Each pn junction can be tested for normal forward- and reverse-biased readings. 
The collector to emitter can also be tested and should result in an overrange in-
dication with either DMM polarity connection. Since a transistor has three leads, 
there are six DMM polarity connections possible. These are shown in Fig. 6-29 a. 
Notice that only two polarity connections result in approximately a 0.7 V reading. 
Also important to note here is that the base lead is the only connection common 
to both 0.7 V readings and it requires a (+) polarity connection. This is also shown 
in Fig. 6-29 b.
A pnp transistor can be tested using the same technique. As shown in 
Fig. 6-30, the pnp transistor also resembles two back-to-back diodes. Again, using 
the DMM in the diode test range, Fig. 6-31 a and 6-31 b show the results for a 
 normal tra nsistor./H11005CC

transistor’s leads into the proper slots, the forward current gain is displayed. This 
current gain is for a specifi  ed base current or collector current and VCE. You can 
check the DMM’s manual for the specifi  c test condition.
Another way to test transistors is with an ohmmeter. You can begin by 
measuring the resistance between the collector and the emitter. This should be 
very high in both directions because the collector and emitter diodes are back to 
back in series. One of the most common troubles is a collector-emitter short, pro-
duced by exceeding the power rating. If you read zero to a few thousand ohms in 
either direction, the transistor is shorted and should be replaced.
Assuming that the collector-emitter resistance is very high in both di-
rections (in megohms), you can read the reverse and forward resistances of the 
collector diode (collector-base terminals) and the emitter diode (base-emitter ter-
minals). You should get a high reverse/forward ratio for both diodes, typically 
more than 1000 ;1 (silicon). If you do not, the transistor is defective.
Even if the transistor passes the ohmmeter tests, it still may have some 
faults. After all, the ohmmeter tests each transistor junction only under dc conditions. 
You can use a curve tracer to look for more subtle faults, such as too much leakage 
current, low /H9252dc, or insuffi  cient breakdown voltage. A transistor being tested with a 
curve tracer is shown in Fig. 6-32. Commercial transistor testers are also available; 
these check the leakage current, current gain /H9252dc, and other quantities.(a)C

Summary
SEC. 6-1   THE UNBIASED 
TRANSISTOR
A transistor has three doped regions: 
an emitter, a base, and a collector. 
A pn junction exists between the 
base and the emitter; this part of the 
transistor is called the emitter diode. 
Another pn junction exists between 
the base and the collector; this part 
of the transistor is called the collector 
diode.
SEC. 6-2  THE BIASED 
TRANSISTOR
For normal operation, you 
forward-bias the emitter diode and 
reverse-bias the collector diode. 
Under these conditions, the emitter 
sends free electrons into the base. 
Most of these free electrons pass 
through the base to the collector. 
Because of this, the collector current 
approximately equals the emitter 
current. The base current is much smaller, typically less than 5 percent 
of the emitter current.
SEC. 6-3   TRANSISTOR 
CURRENTS
The ratio of the collector current to 
the base current is called the current 
gain, symbolized as /H9252dc or hFE. For 
low-power transistors, this is typically 
100 to 300. The emitter current is the 
largest of the three currents, the col-
lector current is almost as large, and 
the base current is much smaller.
SEC. 6-4  THE CE CONNECTION
The emitter is grounded or common 
in a CE circuit. The base-emitter part 
of a transistor acts approximately like 
an ordinary diode. The base-collector 
part acts like a current source that is 
equal to /H9252dc times the base current. 
The transistor has an active region, 
a saturation region, a cutoff   region, 
and a breakdown region. The active 
region is used in linear ampliﬁ  ers. Saturation and cutoff   are used in dig-
ital circuits.
SEC. 6-5  THE BASE CURVE
The graph of base current versus 
base-emitter voltage looks like the 
graph of an ordinary diode. Because 
of this, we can use any of the three 
diode approximations to calculate 
the base current. Most of the time, 
the ideal and the second approxima-
tion are all that is necessary.
SEC. 6-6  COLLECTOR CURVES
The four distinct operating regions of 
a transistor are the active region, the 
saturation region, the cutoff   region, 
and the breakdown region. When it 
is used as an ampliﬁ  er, the transistor 
operates in the active region. When 
it is used in digital circuits, the transis-
tor usually operates in the saturation 
and cutoff   regions. The breakdown 
region is avoided because the risk of 
transistor destruction is too high.232 Chapter 6SEC. 6-7   TRANSISTOR 
APPROXIMATIONS
Exact answers are a waste of time in 
most electronics work. Almost every-
body uses approximations because 
the answers are adequate for most 
applications. The ideal transistor is 
useful for basic troubleshooting. The 
third approximation is needed for 
precise design. The second approx-
imation is a good compromise for 
both troubleshooting and design.
SEC. 6-8   READING DATA 
SHEETS
Transistors have maximum ratings on 
their voltages, currents, and powers. 
Small-signal transistors can dissipate 
1 W or less. Power transistors can 
dissipate more than 1 W. Temper-
ature can change the value of the 
transistor characteristics. Maximum 
power decreases with a temperature 
increase. Also, current gain varies 
greatly with temperature.
SEC. 6-9   SURFACE-MOUNT 
TRANSISTORS
Surface-mount transistors (SMTs) 
are found in a variety of packages. 
A simple three-terminal gull-wing 
package is common. Some SMTs 
are packaged in styles that can dissi-
pate more than 1 W of power. Other 
surface-mount devices may contain 
(house) multiple transistors.SEC. 6-10   VARIATIONS IN 
 CURRENT GAIN
The current gain of a transistor is 
an unpredictable quantity. Because 
of manufacturing tolerances, the 
current gain of a transistor may vary 
over as much as a 3 ;1 range when 
you change from one transistor to 
another of the same type. Changes 
in the temperature and the collector 
current produce additional variations 
in the dc gain.
SEC. 6-11  THE LOAD LINE
The dc load line contains all the 
possible dc operating points of a 
transistor circuit. The upper end of the 
load line is called saturation, and the 
lower end is called cutoff  . The key step 
in ﬁ  nding the saturation current is to 
visualize a short between the collector 
and the emitter. The key step to ﬁ  nding 
the cutoff   voltage is to visualize an 
open between the collector and 
emitter.
SEC. 6-12   THE OPERATING 
POINT
The operating point of the transis-
tor is on the dc load line. The exact 
location of this point is determined 
by the collector current and the 
 collector-emitter voltage. With base 
bias, the Q point moves whenever 
any of the circuit values change.SEC. 6-13   RECOGNIZING 
SATURATION
The idea is to assume that the npn 
transistor is operating in the active 
region. If this leads to a contradiction 
(such as negative collector-emitter 
voltage or collector current greater 
than saturation current), then you 
know that the transistor is operating 
in the saturation region. Another 
way to recognize saturation is by 
comparing the base resistance to the 
collector resistance. If the ratio is in 
the vicinity of 10 ;1, the transistor is 
probably saturated.
SEC. 6-14   THE TRANSISTOR 
SWITCH
Base bias tends to use the transistor 
as a switch. The switching action 
is between cutoff   and saturation. 
This type of operation is useful in 
digital circits. Another name for 
switching circuits is two-state 
circuits.
SEC. 6-15  TROUBLESHOOTING
You can use a DMM or ohmmeter 
to test a transistor. This is best done 
with the transistor disconnected from 
the circuit. When the transistor is in 
the circuit with the power on, you can 
measure its voltages, which are clues 
to possible troubles.

Digital circuits are the type of circuits used in computers. In this area, base bias 
and circuits derived from base bias are useful. But when it comes to amplifi  ers, we 
need circuits whose Q points are immune to changes in current gain.
Figure 7-1 shows emitter bias.  As you can see, the resistor has been 
moved from the base circuit to the emitter circuit. That one change makes all the 
difference in the world. The Q point of this new circuit is now rock-solid. When 
the current gain changes from 50 to 150, the Q point shows almost no movement 
along the load line.
Basic Idea
The base supply voltage is now applied directly to the base. Therefore, a trou-
bleshooter will read VBB between the base and ground. The emitter is no longer 
grounded. Now the emitter is above the ground and has a voltage given by:
VE 5 VBB 2 VBE (7-1)
If VBB is more than 20 times VBE, the ideal approximation will be accurate. If VBB 
is less than 20 times VBE, you may want to use the second approximation. Other-
wise, your error will be more than 5 percent.
Finding the Q Point
Let us analyze the emitter-biased circuit of Fig. 7-2. The base supply voltage is 
only 5 V , so we use the second approximation. The voltage between the base and 
ground is 5 V . From now on, we refer to this base-to-ground voltage as the base 
voltage,  or VB. The voltage across the base-emitter terminals is 0.7 V . We refer to 
this voltage as the base-emitter volt age, or VBE.

It equals:
VE 5 5 V 2 0.7 V  5 4.3 V
This voltage is across the emitter resistance, so we can use Ohm’s law to fi  nd the 
emitter current:
IE 5   4.3 V ______ 2.2 k V   5 1.95 mA
This means that the collector current is 1.95 mA to a close approximation. When 
this collector current fl  ows through the collector resistor, it produces a voltage 
drop of 1.95 V . Subtracting this from the collector supply voltage gives the  voltage 
between the collector and ground:
VC 5 15 V  2 (1.95 mA)(1 k V) 5 13.1 V
From now on, we will refer to this collector-to-ground voltage as the collector 
voltage.
This is the voltage a troubleshooter would measure when testing a transis-
tor circuit. One lead of the voltmeter would be connected to the collector, and the 
other lead would be connected to ground. If you want the collector-emitter voltage, 
you have to subtract the emitter voltage from the collector voltage as follows:
VCE 5 13.1 V  2 4.3 V  5 8.8 V
So, the emitter-biased circuit of Fig. 7-2 has a Q point with these coordinates: 
IC 5 1.95 mA and VCE 5 8.8 V .
The collector-emitter voltage is the voltage used for drawing load lines 
and for reading transistor data sheets. As a formula:
VCE 5 VC 2 VE (7-2)
Circuit Is Immune to Changes in Current Gain
Here is why emitter bias excels. The Q point of an emitter-biased circuit is  immune 
to changes in current gain. The proof lies in the process used to analyze the circuit. 
Here are the steps we used earlier:
1. Get the emitter voltage.
2. Calculate the emitter current.
3. Find the collector voltage.
4. Subtract the emitter from the collector voltage to get VCE.
At no time do we need to use the current gain in the foregoing process. Since we 
don’t use it to fi  nd the emitter current, collector current, and so on, the exact value 
of current gain no longer matters.
By moving the resistor from the base to the emitter circuit, we force the 
base-to-ground voltage to equal the base supply voltage. Before, almost all this 
supply voltage was across the base resistor, setting up a fi  xed base current.  Now, 
all this supply voltage minus 0.7 V is across the emitter resistor, setting up a fi  xed 
emitter current.
Minor Eff  ect of Current Gain
The current gain has a minor effect on the collector current. Under all operating 
conditions, the three currents are related by:
IE 5 IC 1 IB
which can be rearranged as:
IE 5 IC 1   IC ___ /H9252dc  GOOD TO KNOW
Because the values of IC and VCE 
are not affected by the value of 
beta in an emitter-biased circuit, 
this type of circuit is said to be 
beta-independent .244 Chapter 7
Solve this for the collector current, and you get:
IC 5    /H9252dc _______ /H9252dc 1 1    IE (7-3)
The quantity that multiplies IE is called a correction factor.  It tells you how IC
differs from IE. When the current gain is 100, the correction factor is:
/H9252dc _______ /H9252dc 1 1   5   100 _______ 100 1 1   5 0.99
This means that the collector current is equal to 99 percent of the emitter current. 
Therefore, we get only a 1 percent error when we ignore the correction factor and 
say that the collector current equals the emitter current.

What is the voltage between the collector and ground in the Multisim Fig. 7-3? 
Between the collector and the emitter?

 Figure 7- 3  Meter Values.BJT Biasing 2457-2 LED Drivers
You have learned that base-biased circuits set up a fi  xed value of base current, 
and emitter-biased circuits set up a fi  xed value of emitter current. Because of the 
problem with current gain, base-biased circuits are normally designed to switch 
 between saturation and cutoff, whereas emitter-biased circuits are usually de-
signed to operate in the active region.
In this section, we discuss two circuits that can be used as LED drivers. 
The fi  rst circuit uses base bias, and the second circuit uses emitter bias. This will 
give you a chance to see how each circuit performs in the same application.
Base-Biased LED Driver
The base current is zero in Fig. 7-4 a, which means that the transistor is at cut-
off. When the switch of Fig. 7-4 a closes, the transistor goes into hard saturation. 
 Visualize a short between the collector-emitter terminals. Then the collector sup-
ply voltage (15 V) appears across the series connection of the 1.5 k V and the 
LED. If we ignore the voltage drop across the LED, the collector current is ideally 
10 mA. But if we allow 2 V across the LED, then there is 13 V across the 1.5 k V, 
and the collector current is 13 V divided by 1.5 k V, or 8.67 mA.
This voltage is across the emitter resistance, which is now 1 k V. Therefore, the 
emitter current is 4.3 V divided by 1 k V, or:
IE 5 4.3 V_____
1 k 
V 5 4.3 mA
The collector current is approximately equal to 4.3 mA. When this current fl  ows 
through the collector resistance (now 2 k V), it produces a voltage of:
ICRC 5 (4.3 mA)(2 k V) 5 8.6 V
When you subtract this voltage from the collector supply voltage, you get:
VC 5 15 V  2 8.6 V  5 6.4 V
This voltage value is very close to the value measured by the Multisim  meter. 
Remember, this is the voltage between the collector and ground. This is what 
you would measure when troubleshooting.
Unless you have a voltmeter with a high input resistance and a fl  oating 
ground lead, you should not attempt to connect a voltmeter directly between the 
collector and the emitter because this may short the emitter to ground. If you want 
to know the value of VCE, you should measure the collector-to-ground voltage, 
then measure the emitter-to-ground voltage, and subtract the two. In this case:
VCE 5 6.4 V  2 4.3 V  5 2.1 V
PRACTICE PROBLEM 7-1    Decrease the base supply 
 voltage of Fig. 7-3 to 3 V . Predict and measure the new value of VCE.246 Chapter 7There is nothing wrong with this circuit. It makes a fi  ne LED driver 
 because it is designed for hard saturation, where the current gain doesn’t mat-
ter. If you want to change the LED current in this circuit, you can change either 
the collector resistance or the collector supply voltage. The base resistance is 
made 10 times larger than the collector resistance because we want hard satura-
tion when the switch is closed.
Emitter-Biased LED Driver
The emitter current is zero in Fig. 7-4 b, which means that the transistor is at 
cutoff. When the switch of Fig. 7-4 b closes, the transistor goes into the active 
 region. Ideally, the emitter voltage is 15 V . This means that we get an emitter 
current of 10 mA. This time, the LED voltage drop has no effect. It doesn’t mat-
ter whether the exact LED voltage is 1.8, 2, or 2.5 V . This is an advantage of the 
 emitter-biased design over the base-biased design. The LED current is indepen-
dent of the LED voltage. Another advantage is that the circuit doesn’t require a 
collector resistor.
The emitter-biased circuit of Fig. 7-4 b operates in the active region when 
the switch is closed. To change the LED current, you can change the base supply 
voltage or the emitter resistance. For instance, if you vary the base supply voltage, 
the LED current varies in direct proportion.(a)VCC

Application Example 7-2
We want 25 mA of LED current when the switch is closed in Fig. 7-4 b. How can we do it?
SOLUTION   One solution is to increase the base supply. We want 25 mA to fl  ow through the emitter resistance of 
1.5 k V. Ohm’s law tells us that the emitter voltage has to be:
VE 5 (25 mA)(1.5 k V) 5 37.5 V
Ideally, VBB 5 37.5 V. To a second approximation, VBB 5 38.2 V. This is a bit high for typical power supplies. But the 
 solution is workable if the particular  application allows this high a supply voltage.
A supply voltage of 15 V is common in electronics. Therefore, a better solution in most applications is to  decrease 
the emitter resistance. Ideally, the emitter voltage will be 15 V, and we want 25 mA through the emitter resistor. Ohm’s 
law gives:
RE 5   15 V ______ 25 mA   5 600 V
The nearest standard value with a tolerance of 5 percent is 620 V. If we use the second approximation, the resistance is:
RE 5   14.3 V ______ 25 mA   5 572 V
The nearest standard value is 560 V.

Bias Circuits
When a transistor is disconnected from the circuit, you can use a DMM or ohm-
meter to test the transistor. When the transistor is in the circuit with power on, you 
can measure its voltages, which are clues to possible troubles.
In-Circuit Tests
The simplest in-circuit tests measure transistor voltages with respect to ground. 
For instance, measuring the collector voltage VC and the emitter voltage VE is a 
SOLUTION   This is a blown-fuse indicator for a dc power supply. When the fuse is intact, the transistor is base-biased 
into saturation. This turns on the green LED to indicate that all is OK. The voltage between point A and ground is approxi-
mately 2 V . This voltage is not enough to turn on the red LED. The two series diodes ( D1 and D2) prevent the red LED from 
turning on because they require a drop of 1.4 V to conduct.
When the fuse blows, the transistor goes into cutoff, turning off the green LED. Then, the voltage of point A is 
pulled up toward the supply voltage. Now there is enough voltage to turn on the two series diodes and the red LED to indi-
cate a blown fuse. Summary Table 7-1 illustrates the differences between base bias and emitter bias.

Applications Switching/digital circuits Controlled IC drivers and ampliﬁ  ersBJT Biasing 249good start. The difference VC 2 VE should be more than 1 V but less than VCC. If 
the reading is less than 1 V in an amplifi  er circuit, the transistor may be shorted. 
If the reading equals VCC, the transistor may be open.
The foregoing test usually pins down a dc trouble if one exists. Many 
people include a test of VBE, done as follows: Measure the base voltage VB and 
the emitter voltage VE. The difference of these readings is VBE, which should be 
0.6 to 0.7 V for small-signal transistors operating in the active region. For power 
transistors, VBE may be 1 V or more because of the bulk resistance of the emitter 
diode. If the VBE reading is less than approximately 0.6 V, the emitter diode is 
not being  forward biased. The trouble could be in the transistor or in the biasing 
 components.
Some people include a cutoff test, performed as follows: Short the base-
emitter terminals with a jumper wire. This removes the forward bias on the  emitter 
diode and should force the transistor into cutoff. The collector-to-ground voltage 
should equal the collector supply voltage. If it does not, something is wrong with 
the transistor or the circuitry.
Care should be taken when doing this test. If another device or circuit is 
directly connected to the collector terminal, be sure that the increase in collector-
to-ground voltage will not cause any damage.
A Table of Troubles
As discussed in basic electronics, a shorted component is equivalent to a resis-
tance of zero, and an open component is equivalent to a resistance of infi  nity. 
For instance, the emitter resistor may be shorted or open. Let us designate these 
troubles by RES and REO, respectively. Similarly, the collector resistor may be 
shorted or open, symbolized by RCS and RCO, respectively.
When a transistor is defective, anything can happen. For instance, one or 
both diodes may be internally shorted or open. We are going to limit the number of 
possibilities to the most likely defects as follows: a collector-emitter short ( CES) 
will represent all three terminals shorted together (base, collector, and emitter), 
and a collector-emitter open ( CEO ) stands for all three terminals open. A base-
emitter open ( BEO ) means that the base-emitter diode is open, and a collector-
base open ( CBO ) means that the collector-base diode is open.
Summary Table 7-2 shows a few of the troubles that could occur in 
a circuit like Fig. 7-6. The voltages were calculated by using the second ap-
proximation. When the circuit is operating normally, you should measure a 
base voltage of 2 V, an emitter voltage of 1.3 V, and a collector voltage of 
approximately 10.3 V. If the emitter resistor were shorted, 12 V would appear 
across the emitter diode. This large voltage would destroy the transistor, pos-
sibly producing a collector-emitter open. This trouble RES and its voltages are 
shown in Summary Table 7-2.
If the emitter resistor were open, there would be no emitter current. Fur-
thermore, the collector current would be zero, and the collector voltage would 
 increase to 15 V. This trouble REO and its voltages are shown in Summary Table 7-2. 
Continuing like this, we can get the remaining entries of the table.
Notice the entry for no VCC. This is worth commenting on. Your initial 
instinct might be that the collector voltage is zero, because there is no collec-
tor supply voltage. But that is not what you will measure with a voltmeter. 
When you connect a voltmeter between the collector and ground, the base 
supply will set up a small forward current through the collector diode in series 
with the voltmeter. Since the base voltage is fi  xed at 2 V, the collector voltage 
is 0.7 V less than this. Therefore, the voltmeter will read 1.3 V between the 
collector and ground. In other words, the voltmeter completes the circuit to 
ground because the voltmeter looks like a very large resistance in series with 
the collector diode.Figure 7-6  In-circuit tests.

As mentioned earlier, a transistor with an open base has a small collector cur-
rent consisting of thermally produced minority carriers and surface leakage. By 
 exposing the collector junction to light, a manufacturer can produce a phototran-
sistor,  a device that has more sensitivity to light than a photodiode.
Basic Idea of Phototransistors
Figure 7-7 a shows a transistor with an open base. As mentioned earlier, a small 
collector current exists in this circuit. Ignore the surface-leakage component, and 
concentrate on the thermally produced carriers in the collector diode. Visualize 
the reverse current produced by these carriers as an ideal current source in parallel 
with the collector-base junction of an ideal transistor (Fig. 7-7 b).
Because the base lead is open, all the reverse current is forced into the 
base of the transistor. The resulting collector current is:
ICEO 5 /H9252dcIR
where IR is the reverse minority carrier current. This says that the collector current 
is higher than the original reverse current by a factor of /H9252dc.
The collector diode is sensitive to light as well as heat. In a phototransis-
tor, light passes through a window and strikes the collector-base junction. As the 
light increases, IR increases, and so does ICEO.
Phototransistor versus Photodiode
The main difference between a phototransistor and a photodiode is the current 
gain /H9252dc. The same amount of light striking both devices produces /H9252dc times more 
current in a phototransistor than in a photodiode. The increased sensitivity of a 
phototransistor is a big advantage over that of a photodiode.
Figure 7-8 a shows the schematic symbol of a phototransistor. Notice the 
open base. This is the usual way to operate a phototransistor. You can control the Summary Table 7-2 Troubles and Symptoms

left open to get maximum sensitivity to light.
The price paid for increased sensitivity is reduced speed. A phototran-
sistor is more sensitive than a photodiode, but it cannot turn on and off as fast. A 
 photodiode has typical output currents in microamperes and can switch on and off 
in nanoseconds. The phototransistor has typical output currents in milliamperes but 
switches on and off in microseconds. A typical phototransistor is shown in Fig. 7-8 c.
Optocoupler
Figure 7-9 a shows an LED driving a phototransistor. This is a much more sen-
sitive optocoupler than the LED-photodiode discussed earlier. The idea is straight-
forward. Any changes in VS produce changes in the LED current, which changes 
the current through the phototransistor. In turn, this produces a changing voltage 
across the collector-emitter terminals. Therefore, a signal voltage is coupled from 
the input circuit to the output circuit.
Again, the big advantage of an optocoupler is the electrical isolation 
 between the input and output circuits. Stated another way, the common for the 
input circuit is different from the common for the output circuit. Because of this, 
no conductive path exists between the two circuits. This means that you can 
ground one of the circuits and fl  oat the other. For instance, the input circuit can be 
grounded to the chassis of the equipment, while the common of the output side is 
ungrounded. Figure 7-9 b shows a typical optocoupler IC.

GOOD TO KNOW
The optocoupler was actu-
ally designed as a solid-state 
replacement for a mechanical 
relay. Functionally, the opto-
coupler is similar to its older 
mechanical counterpart be-
cause it offers a high degree of 
isolation between its input and 
its output terminals. Some of the 
advantages of using an optocou-
pler versus a mechanical relay 
are faster operating speeds, no 
bouncing of contacts, smaller 
size, no moving parts to stick, 
and compatibility with digital 
microprocessor circuits.252 Chapter 7

 Ch t 7Application Example 7-4
What does the circuit in Fig. 7-10 do?
The 4N24 optocoupler in Fig. 7-10 a provides isolation from the power line and detects zero crossings of line volt-
age. The graph in Fig. 7-10 b shows how the collector current is related to the LED current. Here is how you can calculate 
the peak output voltage from the optocoupler:
The bridge rectifi  er produces a full-wave current through the LED.  Ignoring diode drops, the peak current through 
the LED is:
ILED 5   1.414(115 V)  ___________  16 kV   5 10.2 mA
The saturated value of the phototransistor current is:
IC(sat) 5   20 V ______ 10 
kV   5 2 mA
Figure 7-10 b shows the static curves of phototransistor current versus LED current for three different optocouplers. 
With a 4N24 (top curve), an LED current of 10.2 mA produces a collector current of approximately 15 mA when the load 
resistance is zero. In Fig. 7-10 a, the phototransistor current never reaches 15 mA because the phototransistor saturates at 2 mA. 
In other words, there is more than enough LED current to produce saturation. Since the peak LED current is 10.2 mA, the 
transistor is saturated during most of the cycle. At this time, the output voltage is approximately zero, as shown in Fig. 7-10 c.

The zero crossings occur when the line voltage is changing polarity, from positive to negative, or vice versa. At 
a zero crossing, the LED current drops to zero. At this instant, the phototransistor becomes an open circuit, and the output 
voltage increases to approximately 20 V, as indicated in Fig. 7-10 c. As you can see, the output voltage is near zero most of 
the cycle. At the zero crossings, it  increases rapidly to 20 V and then decreases to the baseline.
A circuit like Fig. 7-10 a is useful because it does not require a transformer to provide isolation from the line. The 
photocoupler takes care of this. Furthermore, the circuit detects zero crossings, desirable in applications where you want to 
synchronize some other circuit to the frequency of the line voltage.BJT Biasing 2537-5 Voltage-Divider Bias
Figure 7-11 a shows the most widely used biasing circuit. Notice that the base 
circuit contains a voltage divider ( R1 and R2). Because of this, the circuit is called 
voltage-divider bias (VDB).
Simpliﬁ  ed Analysis
For troubleshooting and preliminary analysis, use the following method. In any 
well-designed VDB circuit, the base current is much smaller than the current 
through the voltage divider. Since the base current has a negligible effect on the 
voltage divider, we can mentally open the connection between the voltage divider 
and the base to get the equivalent circuit in Fig. 7-11 b. In this circuit, the output 
of the voltage divider is:
VBB5R2 _______
R1 /H11001 R2VCC
Ideally, this is the base-supply voltage as shown in Fig. 7-11 c.
As you can see, voltage-divider bias is really emitter bias in disguise. In 
other words, Fig. 7-11 c is an equivalent circuit for Fig. 7-11 a. This is why VDB 
sets up a fi  xed value of emitter current, resulting in a solid Q point that is inde-
pendent of the current gain.
There is an error in this simplifi  ed approach, however, and we will dis-
cuss it in the next section. The crucial point is this: In any well-designed circuit, 
the error in using Fig. 7-11 c is very small. In other words, a designer deliberately 
chooses  circuit values so that Fig. 7-11 a acts like Fig. 7-11 c.
Conclusion
After you calculate VBB, the rest of the analysis is the same as discussed earlier 
for emitter bias. Here is a summary of the equations you can use to  analyze 
VDB:

These equations are based on Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws. Here are the steps in 
the analysis:
1. Calculate the base voltage VBB out of the voltage divider.
2. Subtract 0.7 V to get the emitter voltage (use 0.3 V for germanium).
3. Divide by the emitter resistance to get the emitter current.
4. Assume that the collector current is approximately equal to the emitter 
current.R1

Example 7-5 
What is the collector-emitter voltage in Fig. 7-12?
SOLUTION  The voltage divider produces an unloaded output voltage of:
VBB 5   2.2 k V ______________   10 kV 1 2.2 k V   10 V 5 1.8 V
Subtract 0.7 V from this to get:

The emitter current is:
IE 5   1.1 V _____ 1 kV   5 1.1 mA
Since the collector current almost equals the emitter current, we can calculate the 
collector-to-ground voltage like this:
VC 5 10 V  2 (1.1 mA)(3.6 k V) 5 6.04 V
The collector-emitter voltage is:
VCE 5 6.04 2 1.1 V  5 4.94 V
Here is an important point: The calculations in this preliminary analysis 
do not depend on changes in the transistor, the collector current, or the tempera-
ture. This is why the Q point of this circuit is stable, almost rock-solid.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 7-5   Change the power supply voltage in Fig. 7-12 
from 10 V to 15 V and solve for VCE.
Example 7-6 
Discuss the signifi  cance of Fig. 7-13, which shows a Multisim analysis of the 
same circuit analyzed in the preceding example.
SOLUTION  This really drives the point home. Here we have an almost iden-
tical answer using a computer to analyze the circuit. As you can see, the voltmeter 
reads 6.07 V (rounded to two places). Compare this to 6.04 V in the preceding 
example, and you can see the point. A simplifi  ed analysis has produced essentially 
the same result as a computer analysis.
You can expect this kind of close agreement whenever a VDB circuit 
has been well designed. After all, the whole point of VDB is to act like emitter 
bias to virtually eliminate the effects of changing the transistor, collector current, 
or temperature.VCC

7-6 Accurate VDB Analysis
What is a well-designed VDB circuit? It is one in which the voltage divider 
 appears stiff to the input resistance of the base.  The meaning of the last sentence 
needs to be discussed.
Source Resistance
In a stiff voltage source, we can ignore the source resistance when it is at least 100 
times smaller than the load resistance:
Stiff voltage source: RS , 0.01RL
When this condition is satisfi  ed, the load voltage is within 1 percent of the ideal 
voltage. Now, let us extend this idea to the voltage divider.256 Chapter 7What is the Thevenin resistance of the voltage divider in Fig. 7-14 a? 
Looking back into the voltage divider with VCC grounded, we see R1 in parallel 
with R2. As an equation:
RTH 5 R1iR2
Because of this resistance, the output voltage of the voltage divider is 
not ideal. A more accurate analysis includes the Thevenin resistance, as shown in 
Fig. 7-14 b. The current through this Thevenin resistance reduces the base voltage 
from the ideal value of VBB.
Load Resistance
How much less than ideal is the base voltage? The voltage divider has to supply 
the base current in Fig. 7-14 b. Put another way, the voltage divider sees a load 
 resistance of RIN, as shown in Fig. 7-14 c. For the voltage divider to appear stiff to 
the base, the 100 ;1 rule:
RS , 0.01RL
translates to:
R1/H20648R2 /H11021 0.01RIN (7-10)
A well-designed VDB circuit will satisfy this condition.
Stiff   Voltage Divider
If the transistor in Fig. 7-14 c has a current gain of 100, its collector current is 
100 times greater than the base current. This implies that the emitter current 
is also 100 times greater than the base current. When seen from the base side 
of the transistor, the emitter resistance RE appears to be 100 times larger. As a 
derivation:
RIN 5 bdcRE (7-11)
Therefore, Eq. (7-10) may be written as:
Stiff voltage divider: R1/H20648R2 /H11021 0.01bdcRE (7-12)
Whenever possible, a designer selects circuit values to satisfy this 100 ;1 rule 
 because it will produce an ultrastable Q point.RERC

Firm Voltage Divider
Sometimes, a stiff design results in such small values of R1 and R2 that other prob-
lems arise (discussed later). In this case, many designers compromise by using 
this rule:
Firm voltage divider: R1/H20648R2 /H11021 0.1bdcRE  (7-13)
We call any voltage divider that satisfi  es this 10 ;1 rule a fi rm voltage divider.  In 
the worst case, using a fi  rm voltage divider means that the collector current will 
be approximately 10 percent lower than the stiff value. This is acceptable in many 
applications because the VDB circuit still has a reasonably stable Q point.
A Closer Approximation
If you want a more accurate value for the emitter current, you can use the follow-
ing derivation:
IE 5    VBB 2 VBE  _______________   RE 1 (R1/H20648R2)//H9252dc     (7-14)
This differs from the stiff value because ( R1iR2)y/H9252dc is in the denominator. As this 
term approaches zero, the equation simplifi  es to the stiff value.
Equation (7-14) will improve the analysis, but it is a fairly complicated 
formula. If you have a computer and need a more accurate analysis obtained with 
the stiff analysis, you should use Multisim or an equivalent circuit simulator.
Example 7-7  
Is the voltage divider in Fig. 7-15 stiff? Calculate the more accurate value of emit-
ter current using Eq. (7-14).
SOLUTION  Check to see whether the 100 :1 rule has been used:

and one-hundredth of this is:
0.01/H9252dcRE 5 2 kV
Since 1.8 k V is less than 2 k V, the voltage divider is stiff.
With Eq. (7-14), the emitter current is:

Because of the stiff voltage divider in Fig. 7-16, the emitter voltage is held con-
stant at 1.1 V in the following discussion.
The Q Point
The Q point was calculated in Sec. 7-5. It has a collector current of 1.1 mA and 
a collector-emitter voltage of 4.94 V . These values are plotted to get the Q point 
shown in Fig. 7-16. Since voltage-divider bias is derived from emitter bias, the Q
point is virtually immune to changes in current gain. One way to move the Q point 
in Fig. 7-16 is by varying the emitter resistor.
For instance, if the emitter resistance is changed to 2.2 k V, the collector 
current decreases to:
IE 5   1.1
 V ______ 2.2 
kV   5 0.5 mA
The voltages change as follows:
VC 5 10 V  2 (0.5 mA)(3.6 k V) 5 8.2 V
and
VCE 5 8.2 V  2 1.1 V  5 7.1 V
Therefore, the new Q point will be QL and will have coordinates of 0.5 mA and 
7.1 V .
On the other hand, if we decrease the emitter resistance to 510 V, the 
emitter current increases to:
IE 5   1.1
 V ______ 510 
V   5 2.15 mA
and the voltages change to:
VC 5 10 V  2 (2.15 mA)(3.6 k V) 5 2.26 V
The point is this: You don’t have to use Eq. (7-14) to calculate emitter 
current when the voltage divider is stiff. Even when the voltage divider is fi  rm, the 
use of Eq. (7-14) will improve the calculation for emitter current only by at most 
10 percent. Unless otherwise indicated, from now on, all analysis of VDB circuits 
will use the simplifi  ed method.

In this case, the Q point shifts to a new position at QH with coordinates of 2.15 mA 
and 1.16 V .
Q Point in Middle of Load Line
VCC, R1, R2, and RC control the saturation current and the cutoff voltage. A change 
in any of these quantities will change IC(sat) and/or VCE(cutoff) . Once the designer 
has established the values of the foregoing variables, the emitter resistance  is 
varied to set the Q point at any position along the load line. If RE is too large, the 
Q point moves into the cutoff point. If RE is too small, the Q point moves into 
saturation. Some designers set the Q point at the middle of the load line. When we 
examine transistor amplifi  ers, the dc load line Q point will be adjusted from the 
middle of the dc load line to achieve maximum output signal.
VDB Design Guideline
Figure 7-17 shows a VDB circuit. This circuit will be used to demonstrate a simpli-
fi ed design guideline to establish a stable Q point. This design technique is suitable 
for most circuits, but it is only a guideline. Other design techniques can be used.
Before starting the design, it is important to determine the circuit re-
quirements or specifi  cations. The circuit is normally biased for VCE to be at a 
midpoint value with a specifi  ed collector current. You also need to know the value 
of VCC and the range of /H9252dc for the transistor being used. Also, be sure the circuit 
will not cause the transistor to exceed its power dissipation limits.
Start by making the emitter voltage approximately one-tenth of the sup-
ply voltage:
VE 5 0.1 VCC
Next, calculate the value of RE to set up the specifi  ed collector current:
RE 5   VE ___ IE  
Since the Q point needs to be at approximately the middle of the dc load 
line, about 0.5 VCC appears across the collector-emitter terminals. The remaining 
0.4 VCC appears across the collector resistor; therefore:
RC 5 4 RE
Next, design for a stiff voltage divider using the 100 :1 rule:
RTH # 0.01 /H9252dc RE
Usually, R2 is smaller than R1. Therefore, the stiff voltage divider equa-
tion can be simplifi  ed to:
R2 # 0.01 /H9252dc RE
You may also choose to design for a fi  rm voltage divider by using the 
10 :1 rule:
R2 # 0.1 /H9252dc RE
In either case, use the minimum-rated /H9252dc value at the specifi  ed collector current.
Finally, calculate R1 by using proportion:

Centering the Q point on a 
transistor load line is important 
because it allows for the maxi-

amplifier. Centering the Q point 
on the dc load line is sometimes 
referred to as midpoint bias.260 Chapter 77-8 Two-Supply Emitter Bias
Some electronics equipment have a power supply that produces both positive 
and negative supply voltages. For instance, Fig. 7-18 shows a transistor circuit 
with two power supplies: 110 and 22 V . The negative supply forward-biases the 
emitter diode. The positive supply reverse-biases the collector diode. This circuit 
Application Example 7-8
For the circuit shown in Fig. 7-17, design the resistor values to meet these 
 specifi  cations:
VCC 5 10 V     VCE @ midpoint
IC 5 10 mA      2N3904’s /H9252dc 5 100–300
SOLUTION   First, establish the emitter voltage by:
VE 5 0.1 VCC
VE 5 (0.1) (10 V) 5 1 V
The emitter resistor is found by:
RE 5   VE ___ IE

The collector resistor is:
RC 5 4 RE
RC 5 (4) (100 V) 5 400 V (use 390 V)
Next, choose either a stiff or fi  rm voltage divider. A stiff value of R2 is found by:
R2 # 0.01 /H9252dc RE
R2 # (0.01) (100) (100 V) 5 100 V
Now, the value of R1 is:

bias (TSEB).
Analysis
The fi  rst thing to do is redraw the circuit as it usually appears on schematic 
 diagrams. This means deleting the battery symbols, as shown in Fig. 7-19. This 
is necessary on schematic diagrams because there usually is no room for battery 
symbols on complicated diagrams. All the information is still on the diagram, 
 except that it is in condensed form. That is, a negative supply voltage of 22 V 
is applied to the bottom of the 1 k V, and a positive supply voltage of 110 V is 
 applied to the top of the 3.6-k V resistor.
When this type of circuit is correctly designed, the base current will 
be small enough to ignore. This is equivalent to saying that the base voltage is 
 approximately 0 V, as shown in Fig. 7-20.
The voltage across the emitter diode is 0.7 V, which is why 20.7 V is 
shown on the emitter node. If this is not clear, stop and think about it. There is a 
plus-to-minus drop of 0.7 V going from the base to the emitter. If the base voltage 
is 0 V, the emitter voltage must be 20.7 V.
In Fig. 7-20, the emitter resistor again plays the key role in setting up the 
emitter current. To fi  nd this current, apply Ohm’s law to the emitter resistor as  follows: 
The top of the emitter resistor has a voltage of 20.7 V, and the bottom has a voltage of 
22 V. Therefore, the voltage across the emitter resistor equals the difference between 
the two voltages. To get the right answer, subtract the more negative value from the 
more positive value. In this case, the more negative value is  22 V, so:
VRE 5 2 0.7 V  2 (22 V) 5 1.3 V
Once you have found the voltage across the emitter resistor, calculate the 
emitter current with Ohm’s law:
IE 5   1.3 V _____ 1 kV   5 1.3 mA
This current fl  ows through the 3.6 k V and produces a voltage drop that we sub-
tract from 110 V as follows:
VC 5 10 V  2 (1.3 mA)(3.6 k V) 5 5.32 V

the emitter voltage:

When transistors are biased 
using well-designed voltage-

figurations, they are classified 
as beta-independent circuits 
because the values of IC and VCE 
are unaffected by changes in the 
transistor’s beta.262 Chapter 7
When two-supply emitter bias is well designed, it is similar to voltage-
divider bias and satisfi  es this 100 ;1 rule:

Base Voltage
One source of error in the simplifi  ed method is the small voltage across the base 
resistor of Fig. 7-20. Since a small base current fl  ows through this resistance, a 
negative voltage exists between the base and ground. In a well-designed circuit, 
this base voltage is less than 20.1 V . If a designer has to compromise by using a 
larger base resistance, the voltage may be more negative than 20.1 V . If you are 
troubleshooting a circuit like this, the voltage between the base and ground should 
produce a low reading; otherwise, something is wrong with the circuit.
Example 7-9  
What is the collector voltage in Fig. 7-20 if the emitter resistor is increased to 1.8 k V?
SOLUTION  The voltage across the emitter resistor is still 1.3 V . The emitter current is:
IE 5   1.3 V ______ 1.8 k V   5 0.722 mA
The collector voltage is:
VC 5 10 V  2 (0.722 mA)(3.6 k V) 5 7.4 V

A stage  is a transistor and the passive components connected to it. Figure 7-21 shows a three-stage circuit using two- 
supply emitter bias. What are the collector-to-ground voltages for each stage in Fig. 7-21?
SOLUTION  To begin with, ignore the capacitors because they appear as open circuits to dc voltage and currents. Then, 
we are left with three isolated transistors, each using two-supply emitter bias.
The fi  rst stage has an emitter current of:

In this section, we will discuss some other types of bias. A detailed analysis of 
these types of bias is not necessary because they are rarely used in new designs. 
But you should at least be aware of their existence in case you see them on a 
schematic diagram.
Emitter-Feedback Bias
Recall our discussion of base bias (Fig. 7-22 a). This circuit is the worst when 
it comes to setting up a fi  xed Q point. Why? Since the base current is fi  xed, the 
collector current varies when the current gain varies. In a circuit like this, the 
Q point moves all over the load line with transistor replacement and tempera-
ture change.
Historically, the fi  rst attempt at stabilizing the Q point was emitter- 
feedback bias, shown in Fig. 7-22 b. Notice that an emitter resistor has been 
added to the circuit. The basic idea is this: If IC increases, VE increases, causing 
VB to  increase. More VB means less voltage across RB. This results in less IB, 
which  opposes the original increase in IC. It’s called feedback  because the change 
in emitter voltage is being fed back to the base circuit. Also, the feedback is called 
negative  because it opposes the original change in collector current.
Emitter-feedback bias never became popular. The movement of the 
Q point is still too large for most applications that have to be mass-produced. 
Here are the equations for analyzing the emitter-feedback bias:
IE 5    VCC 2 VBE ___________  RE 1 RB//H9252dc     (7-20)
VE 5 IERE (7-21)
VB 5 VE 1 0.7 V (7-22)
VC 5 VCC 2 ICRC (7-23)
The intent of emitter-feedback bias is to swamp  out the variations in 
/H9252dc; that is, RE should be much greater than RB//H9252dc. If this condition is satisfi  ed,

designer cannot select RE large enough to swamp out the effects of /H9252dc without 
cutting off the transistor.
Figure 7-23 a shows an example of an emitter-feedback bias circuit. 
Figure 7-23 b shows the load line and the Q points for two different current gains. 
As you can see, a 3 ;1 variation in current gain produces a large variation in 
 collector current. The circuit is not much better than base bias.
Collector-Feedback Bias
Figure 7-24 a shows collector-feedback bias  (also called self-bias ). Historically, 
this was another attempt at stabilizing the Q point. Again, the basic idea is to 
feed back a voltage to the base in an attempt to neutralize any change in collector RB

sensitive to changes in current gain.266 Chapter 7 current. For instance, suppose the collector current increases. This decreases 
the collector voltage, which decreases the voltage across the base resistor. In turn, 
this decreases the base current, which opposes the original increase in collector 
 current.
Like emitter-feedback bias, collector-feedback bias uses negative feed-
back in an attempt to reduce the original change in collector current. Here are the 
equations for analyzing collector-feedback bias:
IE 5    VCC 2 VBE ___________  RC 1 RB//H9252dc    (7-24)
VB 5 0.7 V (7-25)
VC 5 VCC 2 ICRC (7-26)
The Q point is usually set near the middle of the load line by using a base resist-
ance of:
RB 5 bdcRC (7-27)
Figure 7-24 b shows an example of collector-feedback bias. Figure 7-24 c 
shows the load line and the Q points for two different current gains. As you can 
see, a 3 ;1 variation in current gain produces less variation in collector current 
than emitter-feedback (see Fig. 7-23 b).
Collector-feedback bias is more effective than emitter-feedback bias in 
stabilizing the Q point. Although the circuit is still sensitive to changes in current 
gain, it is used in practice because of its simplicity.
Collector- and Emitter-Feedback Bias
Emitter-feedback bias and collector-feedback bias were the fi  rst steps toward a 
more stable bias for transistor circuits. Even though the idea of negative feedback 
is sound, these circuits fall short because there is not enough negative feedback to 
do the job. This is why the next step in biasing was the circuit shown in Fig. 7-25. 
The basic idea is to use both emitter and collector feedback to try to improve the 
operation.
As it turns out, more is not always better. Combining both types of 
 feedback in one circuit helps, but still falls short of the performance needed 
for mass production. If you come across this circuit, here are the equations for 
 analyzing it:

7-10  Troubleshooting VDB Circuits
Let us discuss troubleshooting voltage-divider bias because this biasing method 
is the most widely used. Figure 7-26 shows the VDB circuit analyzed earlier. Sum-
mary Table 7-4 lists the voltages for the circuit when it is simulated with Multisim. 
The voltmeter used to make the measurements has an input impedance of 10 M V.+VCC
RC
RERBFigure 7-25  Collector-emitter 
feedback bias.BJT Biasing 267Unique Troubles
Often, an open or shorted component produces unique voltages. For instance, the 
only way to get 10 V at the base of the transistor in Fig. 7-26 is with a shorted 
R1. No other shorted or open component can produce the same result. Most of the 
 entries in Summary Table 7-4 produce a unique set of voltages, so you can iden-
tify them without breaking into the circuit to make further tests.
Ambiguous Troubles
Two troubles in Summary Table 7-4 do not produce unique voltages: R1O and R2S. 
They both have measured voltages of 0, 0, and 10 V . With ambiguous troubles like 
this, the troubleshooter has to disconnect one of the suspected components and 
use an ohmmeter or other instrument to test it. For instance, we could disconnect 
R1 and measure its resistance with an ohmmeter. If it’s open, we have found the 
trouble. If it’s OK, then R2 is shorted.
Voltmeter Loading
Whenever you use a voltmeter, you are connecting a new resistance to a circuit. 
This resistance will draw current from the circuit. If the circuit has a large resist-
ance, the voltage being measured will be lower than normal.
For instance, suppose the emitter resistor is open in Fig. 7-26. The base 
voltage is 1.8 V. Since there can be no emitter current with an open emitter resistor, 
the unmeasured voltage between the emitter and ground must also be 1.8 V. When 
you measure VE with a 10-M V voltmeter, you are connecting 10 M V  between the 
emitter and ground. This allows a small emitter current to fl  ow, which produces 
a voltage across the emitter diode. This is why VE 5 1.37 V instead of 1.8 V for

Up to this point, we have concentrated on bias circuits using npn transistors. Many cir-
cuits also use pnp transistors. This type of transistor is often used when the electronics 
equipment has a negative power supply. Also, pnp transistors are used as complements 
to npn transistors when dual (positive and negative) power supplies are available.
Figure 7-27 shows the structure of a pnp transistor along with its sche-
matic symbol. Because the doped regions are of the opposite type, we have to turn 
our thinking around. Specifi  cally, holes are the majority carriers in the emitter 
instead of free electrons. Just as with an npn transistor, to properly bias a pnp 
transistor, the base-emitter diode must be forward biased and the base-collector 
diode must be reverse biased. This is shown in Fig. 7-27.
Basic Ideas
Briefl  y, here is what happens at the atomic level: The emitter injects holes into 
the base. The majority of these holes fl  ow on to the collector. For this reason, the 
collector current is almost equal to the emitter current.
Figure 7-28 shows the three transistor currents. Solid arrows represent 
conventional current, and dashed arrows represent electron fl  ow.
Negative Supply
Figure 7-29 a shows voltage-divider bias with a pnp transistor and a negative sup-
ply voltage of 210 V . The 2N3906 is the complement of the 2N3904; that is, its 
characteristics have the same absolute values as those of the 2N3904, but all cur-
rents and voltage polarities are reversed. Compare this pnp circuit with the npn cir-
cuit in Fig. 7-26. The only differences are the supply voltages and the transistors.
The point is this: Whenever you have a circuit with npn transistors, you 
can often use the same circuit with a negative power supply and pnp transistors.
Because the negative supply voltage produces negative circuit values, 
care needs to be taken when doing circuit calculations. The steps in determining 
the Q point of Fig. 7-29 a would be as follows:
VB 5   R2 _______ R1 1 R2   VCC 5   2.2 k V ______________   10 kV 1 2.2 k V   (210 V) 5 2 1.8 V
With a pnp transistor, the base-emitter junction will be forward biased 
when VE is 0.7 V above VB. Therefore,
VE 5 VB 1 0.7 V
VE 5 21.8 V 1 0.7 V
VE 5 21.1 V
Next, determine the emitter and collector currents:
IE 5   VE ___ RE   5   21.1 V _______ 1 kV   5 1.1 mA
IC ø IE 5 1.1 mA
Now, solve for the collector and collector-emitter voltage values:

Positive power supplies are used more often in transistor circuits than are neg-
ative power supplies. Because of this, you often see pnp transistors drawn up-
side down, as shown in Fig. 7-29 b. Here is how the circuit works: The voltage 
across R2 is  applied to the emitter diode in series with the emitter resistor. This 
sets up the emitter current. The collector current fl  ows through RC, producing a 
collector-to-ground voltage. For troubleshooting, you can calculate VC, VB, and 
VE as follows:
1. Get the voltage across R2.
2. Subtract 0.7 V to get the voltage across the emitter resistor.
3. Get the emitter current.
4. Calculate the collector-to-ground voltage.
5. Calculate the base-to-ground voltage.
6. Calculate the emitter-to-ground voltage.
Example 7-11 
Calculate the three transistor voltages for the pnp circuit in Fig. 7-29 b.
SOLUTION  Start with the voltage across R2. We can calculate this voltage 
using the voltage-divider equation:
V2 5   R2 _______ R1 1 R2   VEE
Alternatively, we can calculate the voltage in a different way: Get the current 
through the voltage divider and then multiply by R2. The calculation looks like this:
I 5   10
 V _______ 12.2 
kV   5 0.82 mA
and
V2 5 (0.82 mA)(2.2 k V) 5 1.8 V
Next, subtract 0.7 V from the foregoing voltage to get the voltage across the 
emitter resistor:
1.8 V  2 0.7 V  5 1.1 V
Then, calculate the emitter current:
IE 5   1.1 V _____ 1 kV   5 1.1 mA
When the collector current fl  ows through the collector resistor, it pro-
duces a collector-to-ground voltage of:
VC 5 (1.1 mA)(3.6 k V) 5 3.96 V
The voltage between the base and ground is:
VB 5 10 V  2 1.8 V  5 8.2 V
The voltage between the emitter and ground is:
VE 5 10 V  2 1.1 V  5 8.9 V
PRACTICE PROBLEM 7-11   For both circuits, Fig. 7-29 a and 7-29 b, change 
the power supply voltage from 10 V to 12 V and calculate VB, VE, VC, and VCE.270 Chapter 7
Summary
SEC. 7-1  EMITTER BIAS
Emitter bias is virtually immune to 
changes in current gain. The process 
for analyzing emitter bias is to ﬁ  nd 
the emitter voltage, emitter current, 
collector voltage, and collector-
emitter voltage. All you need for this 
process is Ohm’s law.
SEC. 7-2  LED DRIVERS
A base-biased LED driver uses 
a saturated or cutoff   transistor to 
 control the current through an LED. 
An emitter-biased LED driver uses 
the active region and cutoff   to control 
the current through the LED.

EMITTER BIAS 
CIRCUITS
You can use a DMM or ohmmeter 
to test a transistor. This is best done 
with the transistor disconnected from 
the circuit. When the transistor is in 
the circuit with the power on, you can 
measure its voltages, which are clues 
to possible troubles.
SEC. 7-4   MORE 
OPTOELECTRONIC 
DEVICES
Because of its bdc, the phototransis-
tor is more sensitive to light than a 
photodiode. Combined with an LED, 
the phototransistor gives us a more sensitive optocoupler. The disadvan-
tage with the phototransistor is that it 
responds more slowly to changes in 
light intensity than a photodiode.
SEC. 7-5   VOLTAGE-DIVIDER 
BIAS
The most famous circuit based on 
the emitter-bias prototype is called 
voltage-divider bias. You can recog-
nize it by the voltage divider in the 
base circuit.
SEC. 7-6   ACCURATE VDB 
ANALYSIS
The key idea is for the base current 
to be much smaller than the current 
through the voltage divider. When 
this condition is satisﬁ  ed, the voltage 
divider holds the base voltage almost 
constant and equal to the unloaded 
voltage out of the voltage divider. 
This produces a solid Q point under 
all operating conditions.
SEC. 7-7   VDB LOAD LINE AND 
Q POINT
The load line is drawn through satu-
ration and cutoff  . The Q point lies on 
the load line, with the exact location 
determined by the biasing. Large 
variations in current gain have almost 
no eff  ect on the Q point because this 
type of bias sets up a constant value 
of emitter current.SEC. 7-8   TWO-SUPPLY 
EMITTER BIAS
This design uses two power supplies: 
one positive and the other negative. 
The idea is to set up a constant value 
of emitter current. The circuit is a var-
iation of the emitter-bias prototype 
discussed earlier.
SEC. 7-9   OTHER TYPES OF BIAS
This section introduced negative 
feedback, a phenomenon that exists 
when an increase in an output quan-
tity produces a decrease in an input 
quantity. It is a brilliant idea that led to 
voltage-divider bias. The other types 
of bias cannot use enough negative 
feedback, so they fail to attain the per-
formance level of voltage-divider bias.

Troubleshooting is an art. Because 
of this, it cannot be reduced to a set 
of rules. You learn troubleshooting 
mostly from experience.

 Basic BJT 
Ampliﬁ  ers
After a transistor has been biased with the Q point near the 
middle of the load line, we can couple a small ac voltage into 
the base. This will produce an ac collector voltage. The ac 
collector voltage looks like the ac base voltage, except that it’s a 
lot bigger. In other words, the ac collector voltage is an ampliﬁ  ed 
version of the ac base voltage.
This chapter will show you how to calculate the voltage gain and 
the ac voltages from the circuit values. This is important when 
troubleshooting because you can measure the ac voltages to 
see whether they are in reasonable agreement with theoretical 
values. This chapter also discusses ampliﬁ  er input/output 
impedances and negative feedback.

In this section, we will discuss a base-biased amplifi  er. A base-biased amplifi  er 
has instructional value because its basic ideas can be used to build more compli-
cated amplifi  ers.
Coupling Capacitor
Figure 8-1 a shows an ac voltage source connected to a capacitor and a resis-
tor. Since the impedance of the capacitor is inversely proportional to frequency, 
the capacitor effectively blocks dc voltage and transmits ac voltage. When the 
frequency is high enough, the capacitive reactance is much smaller than the re-
sistance. In this case, almost all the ac source voltage appears across the resis-
tor. When used in this way, the capacitor is called a coupling capacitor  because 
it couples or transmits the ac signal to the resistor. Coupling capacitors are im-
portant because they allow us to couple an ac signal into an amplifi  er without 
 disturbing its  Q point.
For a coupling capacitor to work properly, its reactance must be much 
smaller than the resistance at the lowest frequency of the ac source.  For instance, 
if the frequency of the ac source varies from 20 Hz to 20 kHz, the worst case 
 occurs at 20 Hz. A circuit designer will select a capacitor whose reactance at 
20 Hz is much smaller than the resistance.
How small is small? As a defi  nition:
Good coupling: XC /H11021 0.1R (8-1)
In words: The reactance should be at least 10 times smaller than the resistance at 
the lowest frequency of operation .
When the 10:1 rule is satisfi  ed, Fig. 8-1 a can be replaced by the equivalent 
circuit in Fig. 8-1 b. Why? The magnitude of impedance in Fig. 8-1 a is given by:
Z 5  Ï— R2 1 XC2  
When you substitute the worst case into this, you get:
Z 5  Ï—— R2 1 (0.1R)2   5  Ï—— R2 1 0.01R2   5  Ï— 1.01R2   5 1.005 R
Since the impedance is within half of a percent of R at the lowest frequency, the 
current in Fig. 8-1 a is only half a percent less than the current in Fig. 8-1 b. Since 
any well-designed circuit satisfi  es the 10:1 rule, we can approximate all coupling 
capacitors as an ac short  (Fig. 8-1 b).
A fi  nal point about coupling capacitors: Since dc voltage has a frequency 
of zero, the reactance of a coupling capacitor is infi  nite at zero frequency. There-
fore, we will use these two approximations for a capacitor:
1. For dc analysis, the capacitor is open.
2. For ac analysis, the capacitor is shorted.

the circuits we analyze from now on will satisfy the 10:1 rule, so that we can 
 visualize a coupling capacitor as shown in Fig. 8-1 c.

fi  nd the value of C needed to act as a good coupling capacitor.
SOLUTION   Following the 10 :1 rule, XC should be 10 times smaller than R at 
the lowest frequency.
Therefore:
XC , 0.1 R at 20 Hz
XC , 200 V at 20 Hz

PRACTICE PROBLEM 8-1   Using Example 8-1, fi  nd the value of C when 
the lowest frequency is 1 kHz and R is 1.6 k V.
DC Circuit
Figure 8-2 a shows a base-biased circuit. The dc base voltage is 0.7 V . Because 
30 V is much greater than 0.7 V , the base current is approximately 30 V divided 
by 1 M V, or:
IB 5 30 /H9262A
With a current gain of 100, the collector current is:
IC 5 3 mA
and the collector voltage is:
VC 5 30 V 2 (3 mA)(5 k V) 5 15 V
So, the Q point is located at 3 mA and 15 V .
Amplifying Circuit
Figure 8-2 b shows how to add components to build an amplifi  er. First, a coupling 
capacitor is used between an ac source and the base. Since the coupling capac-
itor is open to direct current, the same dc base current exists, with or without 
the  capacitor and ac source. Similarly, a coupling capacitor is used between the 
collector and the load resistor of 100 k V. Since this capacitor is open to direct 284 Chapter 8current, the dc collector voltage is the same, with or without the capacitor and load 
resistor. The key idea is that the coupling capacitors prevent the ac source and load 
 resistance from changing the Q point.
In Fig. 8-2 b, the ac source voltage is 100 /H9262V. Since the coupling ca-
pacitor is an ac short, all the ac source voltage appears between the base and the 
ground. This ac voltage produces an ac base current that is added to the existing 
dc base current. In other words, the total base current will have a dc component 
and an ac component.
Figure 8-3 a illustrates the idea. An ac component is superimposed on the 
dc component. On the positive half-cycle, the ac base current adds to the 30  /H9262A of 
the dc base current, and on the negative half-cycle, it subtracts from it.
The ac base current produces an amplifi  ed variation in collector current 
because of the current gain. In Fig. 8-3 b, the collector current has a dc component 
of 3 mA. Superimposed on this is an ac collector current. Since this amplifi  ed 
collector current fl  ows through the collector resistor, it produces a varying volt-
age across the collector resistor. When this voltage is subtracted from the supply 
voltage, we get the collector voltage shown in Fig. 8-3 c.
Again, an ac component is superimposed on a dc component. The collec-
tor voltage is swinging sinusoidally above and below the dc level of 115 V. Also, 
the ac collector voltage is inverted  180° out of phase with the input voltage. Why? 
On the positive half-cycle of the ac base current, the collector current increases, 
producing more voltage across the collector resistor. This means that there is less 
voltage between the collector and ground. Similarly, on the negative half-cycle, Figure 8-2   (a) Base bias; ( b) base-biased ampliﬁ  er.

Voltage Waveforms
Figure 8-4 shows the waveforms for a base-biased amplifi  er. The ac source volt-
age is a small sinusoidal voltage. This is coupled into the base, where it is super-
imposed on the dc component of 10.7 V . The variation in base voltage produces 
sinusoidal variations in base current, collector current, and collector voltage. The 
total collector voltage is an inverted sine wave superimposed on the dc collector 
voltage of 115 V .
Notice the action of the output coupling capacitor. Since it is open to 
direct current, it blocks the dc component of collector voltage. Since it is shorted 
to alternating current, it couples the ac collector voltage to the load resistor. This 
is why the load voltage is a pure ac signal with an average value of zero.Figure 8-3   DC and ac components. ( a) Base current; ( b) collector current;

The voltage gain  of an amplifi  er is defi  ned as the ac output voltage divided by the 
ac input voltage. As a defi  nition:
AV 5   vout ____ vin   (8-2)
For instance, if we measure an ac load voltage of 50 mV with an ac input voltage 
of 100 /H9262V , the voltage gain is:
AV 5   50  mV _______ 100  /H9262V   5 500
This says that the ac output voltage is 500 times larger than the ac input voltage.
Calculating Output Voltage
We can multiply both sides of Eq. (8-2) by vin to get this derivation:
vout 5 AV vin (8-3)
This is useful when you want to calculate the value of vout, given the values of AV 
and vin.
For instance, the triangular symbol shown in Fig. 8-5 a is used to indicate 
an amplifi  er of any design. Since we are given an input voltage of 2 mV and a 
voltage gain of 200, we can calculate an output voltage of:
vout 5 (200)(2 mV) 5 400 mV
Calculating Input Voltage
We can divide both sides of Eq. (8-3) by AV to get this derivation:
vin 5   vout ____ AV    (8-4)
This is useful when you want to calculate the value of vin, given the values vout and 
AV. For instance, the output voltage is 2.5 V in Fig. 8-5 b. With a voltage gain of 
350, the input voltage is:

(b)Basic BJT Ampliﬁ  ers 2878-2 Emitter-Biased Ampliﬁ  er
The base-biased amplifi  er has an unstable Q point. For this reason, it is not used 
much as an amplifi  er. Instead, an emitter-biased amplifi  er (either VDB or TSEB) 
with its stable Q point is preferred.
Bypass Capacitor
A bypass capacitor  is similar to a coupling capacitor because it appears open 
to direct current and shorted to alternating current. But it is not used to couple a 
 signal between two points. Instead, it is used to create an ac ground.
Figure 8-6 a shows an ac voltage source connected to a resistor and 
a  capacitor. The resistance R represents the Thevenin resistance as seen by the 
 capacitor. When the frequency is high enough, the capacitive reactance is much 
smaller than the resistance. In this case, almost all the ac source voltage appears 
across the resistor. Stated another way, point E is effectively shorted to ground.
When used in this way, the capacitor is called a bypass capacitor  because 
it bypasses or shorts point E to ground. A bypass capacitor is important because 
it allows us to create an ac ground in an amplifi  er without disturbing its Q point.
For a bypass capacitor to work properly, its reactance must be much 
smaller than the resistance at the lowest frequency of the ac source.  The defi  nition 
for good bypassing is identical to that for good coupling:
Good bypassing: XC /H11021 0.1R (8-5)
When this rule is satisfi  ed, Fig. 8-6 a can be replaced by the equivalent circuit in 
Fig. 8-6 b.Figure 8-6   (a) Bypass capacitor; 
(b) point E is an ac ground.
Example 8-2
In Fig. 8-7, the input frequency of V is 1 kHz. What value of C is needed to 
 effectively short point E to ground?
SOLUTION   First, fi  nd the Thevenin resistance as seen by the capacitor C.

RTH 5 600 V i 1 kV 5 375 V
Next, XC should be 10 times smaller than RTH. Therefore, XC , 37.5 V at 1 kHz.

Figure 8-8 shows a voltage-divider-biased (VDB) amplifi  er. To calculate the dc 
voltages and currents, mentally open all capacitors. Then, the transistor circuit 
simplifi  es to the VDB circuit analyzed in a previous chapter. The quiescent or dc 
values for this circuit are:
VB 5 1.8 V
VE 5 1.1 V
VC 5 6.04 V
IC 5 1.1 mA
As before, we use a coupling capacitor between the source and base, 
and another coupling capacitor between the collector and the load resistance. We 
also need to use a bypass capacitor between the emitter and ground. Without this 
 capacitor, the ac base current would be much smaller. But with the bypass capac-
itor, we get a much larger voltage gain. 
In Fig. 8-8, the ac input voltage is 100 /H9262V. This is coupled into the 
base. Because of the bypass capacitor, all of this ac voltage appears across the 
base-emitter diode. The ac base current then produces an amplifi  ed ac collector 
voltage, as previously described.
VDB Waveforms
Notice the voltage waveforms in Fig. 8-8. The ac input voltage is a small sinu-
soidal voltage with an average value of zero. The base voltage is an ac voltage 
 superimposed on a dc voltage of 11.8 V . The collector voltage is an amplifi  ed 
and inverted ac voltage superimposed on the dc collector voltage of 16.04 V . 
The load voltage is the same as the collector voltage, except that it has an average 
value of zero.
Notice also the voltage on the emitter. It is a pure dc voltage of 11.1 V. 
There is no ac emitter voltage because emitter is at ac ground, a direct result 
of using a bypass capacitor. This is important to remember because it is useful in 
troubleshooting. If the bypass capacitor were to open, an ac voltage would appear 
between the emitter and ground. This symptom would immediately point to the 
open bypass capacitor as the unique trouble.GOOD TO KNOW
In Fig. 8-8, the emitter voltage is 
rock-solid at 1.1 V because of the 
emitter bypass capacitor. There-
fore, any variations in the base 
voltage appear directly across 
the BE junction of the transistor. 
For example, assume that 
vin 5 10 mV p-p. At the positive 
peak of vin, the ac base voltage 
equals 1.805 V and VBE equals 
1.805 V  2 1.1 V  5 0.705 V. At 
the negative peak of vin, the 
ac base voltage decreases to 
1.795 V, and then VBE equals 
1.795 V  2 1.1 V  5 0.695 V. The 
ac variations in VBE (0.705 to 
0.695 V) are what produce the 
ac variations in IC and VCE.Figure 8-8   VDB ampliﬁ  er with waveforms.

The VDB amplifi  er in Fig. 8-8 is the standard way to build a discrete transistor 
amplifi  er. Discrete  means that all components, such as resistors, capacitors, and 
transistors, are separately inserted and connected to get the fi  nal circuit. A dis-
crete  circuit  differs from an integrated circuit (IC),  in which all the components 
are  simultaneously created and connected on a chip,  a piece of semiconductor 
 material. Later chapters will discuss the op amp,  an IC amplifi  er that produces 
voltage gains of more than 100,000.
TSEB Circuit
Figure 8-9 shows a two-supply emitter bias (TSEB) amplifi  er. We analyzed the dc 
part of the circuit in Chap. 7 and calculated these quiescent voltages:
VB < 0 V
VE 5 20.7 V
VC 5 5.32 V
IC 5 1.3 mA
Figure 8-9 shows two coupling capacitors and an emitter bypass capac-
itor. The ac operation of the circuit is similar to that of a VDB amplifi  er. We 
couple a signal into the base. The signal is amplifi  ed to get the collector voltage. 
The amplifi  ed signal is then coupled to the load.
Notice the waveforms. The ac input voltage is a small sinusoidal volt-
age. The base voltage has a small ac component riding on a dc component of 
 approximately 0 V. The total collector voltage is an inverted sine wave riding on 
the dc collector voltage of 15.32 V. The load voltage vout is the same amplifi  ed 
signal with no dc component.
Again, notice the pure dc voltage on the emitter, a direct result of using 
the bypass capacitor. If the bypass capacitor were to open, an ac voltage would 
 appear at the emitter. This would greatly reduce the voltage gain. Therefore, when 
troubleshooting an amplifi  er with bypass capacitors, remember that all ac grounds 
should have zero ac voltage.

Figure 8-10 shows the graph of current versus voltage for the base-emitter diode. 
When an ac voltage is coupled into the base of a transistor, an ac voltage appears 
across the base-emitter diode. This produces the sinusoidal variation in VBE shown 
in Fig. 8-10.
Instantaneous Operating Point
When the voltage increases to its positive peak, the instantaneous operating point 
moves from Q to the upper point shown in Fig. 8-10. On the other hand, when the 
sine wave decreases to its negative peak, the instantaneous operating point moves 
from Q to the lower point.
The total base-emitter voltage in Fig. 8-10 is an ac voltage centered on a 
dc voltage. The size of the ac voltage determines how far the instantaneous point 
moves away from the Q point. Large ac base voltages produce large variations, 
whereas small ac base voltages produce small variations.
Distortion
The ac voltage on the base produces the ac emitter current shown in Fig. 8-10. 
This ac emitter current has the same frequency as the ac base voltage. For in-
stance, if the ac generator driving the base has a frequency of 1 kHz, the ac emitter 
current has a frequency of 1 kHz. The ac emitter current also has approximately 
the same shape as the ac base voltage. If the ac base voltage is sinusoidal, the ac 
emitter current is approximately sinusoidal.
The ac emitter current is not a perfect replica of the ac base voltage 
because of the curvature of the graph. Since the graph is curved upward, the pos-
itive half-cycle of the ac emitter current is elongated (stretched) and the negative 
half-cycle is compressed. This stretching and compressing of alternate half-cycles 
is called distortion.  It is undesirable in high-fi  delity amplifi  ers because it changes 
the sound of voice and music.
Reducing Distortion
One way to reduce distortion in Fig. 8-10 is by keeping the ac base voltage small. 
When you reduce the peak value of the base voltage, you reduce the movement of 
the instantaneous operating point. The smaller this swing or variation, the less the 
curvature in the graph. If the signal is small enough, the graph appears to be  linear.
Figure 8-10   Distortion when signal is too large.
VBEQIEBasic BJT Ampliﬁ  ers 291Why is this important? Because there is negligible distortion for a small 
signal. When the signal is small, the changes in ac emitter current are almost 
 directly proportional to the changes in ac base voltage because the graph is almost 
linear. In other words, if the ac base voltage is a small enough sine wave, the ac 
emitter current will also be a small sine wave with no noticeable stretching or 
compression of half-cycles.
The 10 Percent Rule
The total emitter current shown in Fig. 8-10 consists of a dc component and an ac 
component, which can be written as:
IE 5 IEQ 1 ie
where IE 5 the total emitter current 
 I EQ 5 the dc emitter current
 i e 5 the ac emitter current
To minimize distortion, the peak-to-peak value of ie must be small com-
pared to IEQ. Our defi  nition of small-signal operation is:
Small signal: ie(p-p) /H11021 0.1IEQ (8-6)
This says that the ac signal is small when the peak-to-peak ac emitter current is 
less than 10 percent of the dc emitter current. For instance, if the dc emitter cur-
rent is 10 mA, as shown in Fig. 8-11, the peak-to-peak emitter current should be 
less than 1 mA in order to have small-signal operation.
From now on, we will refer to amplifi  ers that satisfy the 10 percent rule 
as small-signal amplifi  ers. This type of amplifi  er is used at the front end of radio 
and television receivers because the signal coming in from the antenna is very 
weak. When coupled into a transistor amplifi  er, a weak signal produces very small 
variations in emitter current, much less than the 10 percent rule requires.

The current gain in all discussions up to this point has been dc current gain.  This 
was defi  ned as:
/H9252dc 5   IC __ IB   (8-7)
The currents in this formula are the currents at the Q point in Fig. 8-12. Because 
of the curvature in the graph of IC versus IB, the dc current gain depends on the 
 location of the Q point.
Deﬁ nition
The ac current gain  is different. It is defi  ned as:
/H9252 5   ic __ ib   (8-8)
In words, the ac current gain equals the ac collector current divided by the ac 
base current.  In Fig. 8-12, the ac signal uses only a small part of the graph on both 
sides of the Q point. Because of this, the value of the ac current gain is different 
from the dc current gain, which uses almost all of the graph.
Then solve for the small-signal emitter current ie(p-p)
ie(p-p) , 0.1 IEQ

culate the maximum small-signal emitter current.
Figure 8-12   AC current gain equals ratio of changes.
IBQICBasic BJT Ampliﬁ  ers 293Graphically, /H9252 equals the slope of the curve at the Q point in Fig. 8-12. If 
we were to bias the transistor to a different Q point, the slope of the curve would 
change, which means that /H9252 would change. In other words, the value of /H9252 depends 
on the amount of dc collector current.
On data sheets, /H9252dc is listed as hFE and /H9252 is shown as hfe. Notice that 
capital subscripts are used with dc current gain, and lowercase subscripts with ac 
current gain. The two current gains are comparable in value, not differing by a 
large amount. For this reason, if you have the value of one, you can use the same 
value for the other in preliminary analysis.
Notation
To keep dc quantities distinct from ac quantities, it is standard practice to use 
capital letters and subscripts for dc quantities. For instance, we have been using:
IE, IC, and IB for the dc currents
VE, VC, and VB for the dc voltages
VBE, VCE, and VCB for the dc voltages between terminals
For ac quantities, we will use lowercase letters and subscripts as follows:
ie, ic, and ib for the ac currents
ve, vc, and vb for the ac voltages
vbe, vce, and vcb for the ac voltages between terminals
Also worth mentioning is the use of capital R for dc resistances and lowercase r
for ac resistances. The next section will discuss ac resistance.
8-5  AC Resistance of the 
Emitter Diode
Figure 8-13 shows a graph of current versus voltage for the emitter diode. When 
a small ac voltage is across the emitter diode, it produces the ac emitter current 
shown. The size of this ac emitter current depends on the location of the Q point. 
Because of the curvature, we get more peak-to-peak ac emitter current when the 
Q point is higher up the graph.
Figure 8-13   AC resistance of emitter diode.
VBEIE294 Chapter 8Deﬁ nition
As discussed in Sec. 8-3, the total emitter current has a dc component and an ac 
component. In symbols:
IE 5 IEQ 1 ie
where IEQ is the dc emitter current and ie is the ac emitter current.
In a similar way, the total base-emitter voltage in Fig. 8-13 has a dc com-
ponent and an ac component. Its equation can be written as:
VBE 5 VBEQ 1 vbe
where VBEQ is the dc base-emitter voltage and vbe is the ac base-emitter voltage.
In Fig. 8-13, the sinusoidal variation in VBE produces a sinusoidal vari-
ation in IE. The peak-to-peak value of ie depends on the location of the Q point. 
Because of the curvature in the graph, a fi  xed vbe produces more ie as the Q point 
is biased higher up the curve. Stated another way, the ac resistance of the emitter 
diode decreases when the dc emitter current increases.
The ac emitter resistance of the emitter diode is defi  ned as:
re9 5   vbe ___ ie   (8-9)
This says that the ac resistance of the emitter diode equals the ac base-emitter 
voltage divided by the ac emitter current. The prime ( 9) in r9e is a standard way to 
indicate that the resistance is inside the transistor.
For instance, Fig. 8-14 shows an ac base-emitter voltage of 5 mV p-p. At 
the given Q point, this sets up an ac emitter current of 100 /H9262Ap-p. The ac resist-
ance of the emitter diode is:
re9 5   5 mV _______ 100 /H9262A   5 50 V
As another example, assume that a higher Q point in Fig. 8-14 has vbe 5 5 mV and 
ie 5 200 /H9262A. Then, the ac resistance decreases to:
re9 5   5 mV _______ 200 /H9262A   5 25 V
The point is this: The ac emitter resistance always decreases when the dc emitter 
current increases because vbe is essentially a constant value.

Using solid-state physics and calculus, it is possible to derive the following 
 remarkable formula for the ac emitter resistance:
r9e 5   25 mV ______  IE   (8-10)
This says that the ac resistance of the emitter diode equals 25 mV divided by the 
dc emitter current.
This formula is remarkable because of its simplicity and the fact that 
it applies to all transistor types. It is widely used in the electronics industry to cal-
culate a preliminary value for the ac resistance of the emitter diode. The deriva-
tion assumes small-signal operation, room temperature, and an abrupt rectangular 
base-emitter junction. Since commercial transistors have gradual and nonrectangular 
junctions, there will be some deviations from Eq. (8-10). In practice, almost all com-
mercial transistors have an ac emitter resistance between 25 mV/ IE and 50 mV/ IE.
The reason r9e is important is because it determines the voltage gain. The 
smaller it is, the higher the voltage gain. Section 8-9 will show you how to use r9e
to calculate the voltage gain of a transistor amplifi  er.

To analyze the ac operation of a transistor amplifi  er, we need an ac-equivalent 
 circuit for a transistor. In other words, we need a model for the transistor that 
simulates how it behaves when an ac signal is present.
The T Model
One of the earliest ac models was the Ebers-Moll model  shown in Fig. 8-16. As 
far as a small ac signal is concerned, the emitter diode of a transistor acts like 
an ac resistance r9e and the collector diode acts like a current source ic. Since the 
Ebers-Moll model looks like a T on its side, the equivalent circuit is also called 
the T model.
When analyzing a transistor amplifi  er, we can replace each transistor 
by a T model. Then, we can calculate the value of r9e and other ac quantities like 
voltage gain. The details are discussed later in this chapter.
When an ac input signal drives a transistor amplifi  er, an ac base-emitter 
voltage vbe is across the emitter diode, as shown in Fig. 8-17 a. This produces an ac 
base current ib. The ac voltage source has to supply this ac base current so that the 
transistor amplifi  er will work properly. Stated another way, the ac voltage source 
is loaded by the input impedance of the base.
Figure 8-17 b illustrates the idea. Looking into the base of the transistor, 
the ac voltage source sees an input impedance zin(base) . At low frequencies, this 
impedance is purely resistive and defi  ned as:
zin(base)  5   vbe ___ ib   (8-11)
Applying Ohm’s law to the emitter diode of Fig. 8-17 a, we can write:

zin(base)  5   vbe ___ ib   5   ier9e ___ ib  
Since ie < ic, the foregoing equation simplifi  es to:
zin(base)  5 /H9252r9e (8-12)
This equation tells us that the input impedance of the base is equal to the ac cur-
rent gain multiplied by the ac resistance of the emitter diode.
The /H9266 Model
Figure 8-18 a shows the /H9266 model  of a transistor. It’s a visual representation of 
Eq. (8-12). The /H9266 model is easier to use than the T model (Fig. 8-18 b) because the 
input impedance is not obvious when you look at the T model. On the other hand, 
the /H9266 model clearly shows that an input impedance of /H9252r9e will load the ac voltage 
source driving the base.
Since the /H9266 and T models are ac-equivalent circuits for a transistor, we 
can use either one when analyzing an amplifi  er. Most of the time, we will use the /H9266 
model. With some circuits, the T model gives a better insight into the circuit action. 
Both models are widely used in industry.
8-7 Analyzing an Ampliﬁ  er
Amplifi  er analysis is complicated because both dc and ac sources are in the same 
circuit. To analyze amplifi  ers, we can calculate the effect of the dc sources and 
then the effect of the ac sources. When using the superposition theorem in this 
analysis, the effect of each source acting alone is added to get the total effect of all 
sources acting simultaneously.
The DC-Equivalent Circuit
The simplest way to analyze an amplifi  er is to split the analysis into two parts: a 
dc analysis and an ac analysis. In the dc analysis, we calculate the dc voltages and 
currents. To do this, we mentally open all capacitors. The circuit that remains is 
the dc-equivalent circuit.
With the dc-equivalent circuit, you can calculate the transistor currents 
and voltages as needed. If you are troubleshooting, approximate answers are ade-
quate. The most important current in the dc analysis is the dc emitter current. This 
is needed to calculate r9e for the ac analysis.ic

GOOD TO KNOW
There are other, more accurate 
transistor equivalent circuits 
(models) in addition to those 
shown in Figs. 8-16, 8-17, and 
8-18. A highly accurate equiv-
alent circuit will include some-
thing called the base spreading 
resistance r 9b and the internal 
resistance r 9c of the collector cur-
rent source. This model is used 
if exact answers are desired.Basic BJT Ampliﬁ  ers 299AC Eff  ect of a DC Voltage Source
Figure 8-19 a shows a circuit with ac and dc sources. What is the ac current in a 
circuit like this? As far as the ac current is concerned, the dc voltage source acts 
like an ac short, as shown in Fig. 8-19 b. Why? Because a dc voltage source has 
a constant voltage across it. Therefore, any ac current fl  owing through it cannot 
produce an ac voltage across it. If no ac voltage can exist, the dc voltage source is 
equivalent to an ac short.
Another way to understand the idea is to recall the superposition theorem
discussed in basic electronics courses. In applying superposition to Fig. 8-19 a, 
we can calculate the effect of each source acting separately while the other is 
reduced to zero. Reducing the dc voltage source to zero is equivalent to shorting 
it. Therefore, to calculate the effect of the ac source in Fig. 8-19 a, we can short 
the dc voltage source.
From now on, we will short all dc voltage sources when analyzing the ac 
operation of an amplifi  er. As shown in Fig. 8-19 b, this means that each dc voltage 
supply point acts like an ac ground.
AC-Equivalent Circuit
After analyzing the dc-equivalent circuit, the next step is to analyze the ac- 
equivalent circuit. This is the circuit that remains after you have mentally shorted 
all capacitors and dc voltage sources. The transistor can be replaced by either the 
/H9266 model or the T model. 
Base-Biased Ampliﬁ  er
Figure 8-20 a is a base-biased amplifi  er. After mentally opening all capacitors and 
analyzing the dc-equivalent circuit, we are ready for the ac analysis. To get the 
ac-equivalent circuit, we short all capacitors and dc voltage sources. Then, the 
point labeled 1VCC is an ac ground.
Figure 8-20 b shows the ac-equivalent circuit. As you can see, the tran-
sistor has been replaced by its /H9266 model. In the base circuit, the ac input voltage 
 appears across RB in parallel with /H9252r9e. In the collector circuit, the current source 
pumps an ac current of ic through RC in parallel with RL.
VDB Ampliﬁ  er
Figure 8-21 a is a VDB amplifi  er, and Fig. 8-21 b is its ac-equivalent circuit. As 
you can see, all capacitors have been shorted, the dc supply point has become an 
ac ground, and the transistor has been replaced by its /H9266 model. In the base circuit, 
the ac input voltage appears across R1 in parallel with R2 in parallel with /H9252re9. In 
the collector circuit, the current source pumps an ac current of ic through RC in 
parallel with RL.VCCVpVpRR AC GROUND

 analyzing the dc-equivalent circuit, we can draw the ac-equivalent circuit in 
Fig. 8-22 b. Again, all capacitors are shorted, the dc source voltage becomes an 
ac ground, and the transistor is replaced by its /H9266 model. In the base circuit, the ac RL+VCC

CE Ampliﬁ  ers
The three different amplifi  ers in Figs. 8-20, 8-21, and 8-22 are examples of a 
 common-emitter (CE) amplifi  er. You can recognize a CE amplifi  er immediately 
because its emitter is at ac ground. With a CE amplifi  er, the ac input signal is cou-
pled into the base, and the amplifi  ed output signal appears at the collector. The ac 
grounded emitter is common to both the input and output signals.
Two other basic transistor amplifi  ers are possible. The  common-base 
(CB)  amplifi  er and the common-collector (CC) amplifi  er. The CB amplifi  er has 
its base at ac ground, and the CC amplifi  er has its collector at ac ground. They 
are useful in some applications, but are not as popular as the CE amplifi  er. Later 
chapters discuss the CB and CC amplifi  ers.
Main Ideas
The foregoing method of analysis works for all amplifi  ers. You start with the 
dc-equivalent circuit. After calculating the dc voltages and currents, you analyze 
the ac-equivalent circuit. The crucial ideas in getting the ac-equivalent circuit are:
1. Short all coupling and bypass capacitors.
2. Visualize all dc supply voltages as ac grounds.
3. Replace the transistor by its /H9266 or T model.
4. Draw the ac-equivalent circuit.

Refer to the partial data sheet of a 2N3904 in Fig. 8-23 during the following 
 discussion. The ac quantities appear in the section labeled “Small-Signal Charac-
teristics.” In this section, you will fi  nd four new quantities labeled hfe, hie, hre, and 
hoe. These are called h parameters. What are they?
H Parameters
When the transistor was fi  rst invented, an approach known as the h parameters 
was used to analyze and design transistor circuits. This mathematical approach 
models the transistor on what is happening at its terminals without regard for the 
physical processes taking place inside the transistor.
A more practical approach is the one we are using. It is called the r9
parameter method, and it uses quantities like /H9252 and r9e. With this approach, you 
can use Ohm’s law and other basic ideas in the analysis and design of transistor 
 circuits. This is why the r9 parameters are better suited for most people.
This does not mean that the h parameters are useless. They have survived 
on data sheets because they are easier to measure than r9 parameters. When you 
read data sheets, therefore, don’t look for /H9252, r9e, and other r9 parameters. You 
won’t fi  nd them. Instead, you will fi  nd hfe, hie, hre, and hoe. These four h param-
eters give useful information when translated into r9 parameters.
Relationships Between R and H Parameters
For instance, hfe given in the “Small-Signal Characteristics” section of the data 
sheet is identical to the ac current gain. In symbols, this is represented as:
/H9252 5 hfe
The data sheet lists a minimum hfe of 100 and a maximum of 400. Therefore, 
/H9252 may be as low as 100 or as high as 400. These values are for a collector current 
of 1 mA and a collector-emitter voltage of 10 V .
Another h parameter is the quantity hie, equivalent to the input imped-
ance. The data sheets give a minimum hie of 1 k V and a maximum of 10 k V. The 
quantity hie is related to r9 parameters like this:
r9e 5   hie ___ hfe   (8-13)
For instance, the maximum values of hie and hfe are 10 k V and 400. Therefore:
r9e 5   10 kV ______ 400   5 25 V
The last two h parameters, hre and hoe, are not needed for troubleshooting and 
basic design.
Other Quantities
Other quantities listed under “Small-Signal Characteristics” include fT, Cibo, Cobo, 
and NF. The fi  rst, fT, gives information about the high-frequency limitations on a 
2N3904. The second and third quantities, Cibo and Cobo, are the input and output 
 capacitances of the device. The fi  nal quantity, NF, is the noise fi  gure; it indicates 
how much noise the 2N3904 produces.
The data sheet of a 2N3904 includes a lot of graphs, which are worth 
looking at. For instance, the graph on the data sheet labeled current gain  shows 
that hfe increases from approximately 70 to 160 when the collector current 
 increases from 0.1 mA to 10 mA. Notice that hfe is approximately 125 when the 
collector current is 1 mA. This graph is for a typical 2N3904 at room temperature. 304 Chapter 8300

collector current increases from 0.1 mA to 10 mA. Equation (8-13) tells us how to 
calculate r9e. It says to divide hie by hfe to get r9e. Let’s try it. If you read the value of 
hfe and hie at a  collector current of 1 mA from the graphs on the data sheet, you get 
these  approximate values: hfe 5 125 and hie 5 3.6 k V. With Eq. (8-13):
r9e 5   3.6 k V ______ 125   5 28.8 V
The ideal value of r9e is:
r9e 5   25 mV ______ 1 mA   5 25 V
8-9 Voltage Gain
Figure 8-24 a shows a voltage-divider-biased (VDB) amplifi  er. Voltage gain  was 
defi ned as the ac output voltage divided by the ac input voltage. With this  defi  nition, 
we can derive another equation for voltage gain that is useful in  troubleshooting.

Figure 8-24 b shows the ac-equivalent circuit using the /H9266 model of the transistor. 
The ac base current ib fl  ows through the input impedance of the base ( /H9252re9). With 
Ohm’s law, we can write:
vin 5 ib/H9252r9e 
In the collector circuit, the current source pumps an ac current ic through the par-
allel connection of RC and RL. Therefore, the ac output voltage equals:
vout 5 ic(RC i RL) 5 /H9252ib(RC i RL)
Now, we can divide vout by vin to get:
AV 5   vout ___ vin   5   /H9252ib(RC i RL) __________  ib/H9252r9e  
which simplifi  es to:
AV /H11005   (RC /H20648 RL) ________  r/H11032e   (8-14)
AC Collector Resistance
In Fig. 8-24 b, the total ac load resistance seen by the collector is the parallel com-
bination of RC and RL. This total resistance is called the ac collector resistance,  
symbolized rc. As a defi  nition:
rc /H11005 RC /H20648 RL (8-15)
Now, we can rewrite Eq. (8-14) as:
AV /H11005   rc __ r/H11032e   (8-16)
In words: The voltage gain equals the ac collector resistance divided by the ac 
 resistance of the emitter diode .
Derived from the T Model
Either transistor model gives the same results. Later, we will use the T model 
when analyzing differential amplifi  ers. For practice, let us derive the equation for 
voltage gain using the T model.
Figure 8-24 c shows the ac-equivalent circuit using the T model of the 
transistor. The input voltage vin appears across re9. With Ohm’s law, we can write:
vin 5 iere9
In the collector circuit, the current source pumps an ac current ic through the ac 
collector resistance. Therefore, the ac output voltage equals:
vout 5 icrc
Now, we can divide vout by vin to get:
AV 5   vout ___ vin   5   icrc ___ ier9e  
Since ic < ie, we can simplify the equation to get:
AV 5   rc __ re9  
This is the same equation derived with the /H9266 model. It applies to all CE amplifi  ers 
because all have an ac collector resistance of rc and an emitter diode with an ac 
 resistance of  re9.GOOD TO KNOW
The current gain Ai of a 
 common-emitter amplifier equals 
the ratio of the output current 
iout to the input current iin. The 
output current, however, is not 
ic, as you might think. The output 
current iout is the current flowing 
in the load RL. The equation for 
Ai is derived as follows:
Ai 5   Vout/RL ______ Vin/Zin  
or
Ai 5 Vout/Vin 3 Zin/RL

Input Impedance
Up to now, we have assumed an ideal ac voltage source, one with zero source 
 resistance. In this section, we will discuss how the input impedance of an ampli-
fi er can load down the ac source, that is, reduce the ac voltage appearing across 
the emitter diode.
Input Impedance
In Fig. 8-26 a, an ac voltage source vg has an internal resistance of RG. (The sub-
script g stands for “generator,” a synonym for source .) When the ac generator is 
not stiff, some of the ac source voltage is dropped across its internal resistance. As 
a result, the ac voltage between the base and ground is less than ideal.
The ac generator has to drive the input impedance of the stage zin(stage) . 
This input impedance includes the effects of the biasing resistors R1 and R2, in 
parallel with the input impedance of the base zin(base) . Figure 8-26 b illustrates the 
idea. The input impedance of the stage equals:
zin(stage)  5 R1 i R2 i /H9252r9e
Example 8-8
What is the voltage gain in Fig. 8-25 b? The output voltage across the load  resistor?
SOLUTION  The ac collector resistance is:
rc 5 RC i RL 5 (3.6 k V i 2.2 k V) 5 1.37 k V
The dc emitter current is approximately:
IE 5   9 V 2 0.7 V ___________  10 kV   5 0.83 mA
The ac resistance of the emitter diode is:

Equation for Input Voltage
When the generator is not stiff, the ac input voltage vin of Fig. 8-26 c is less than 
vg. With the voltage-divider theorem, we can write:
vin /H11005   zin(stage) ___________   RG /H11001 zin(stage)   vg (8-17)
This equation is valid for any amplifi  er. After you calculate or estimate the input 
impedance of the stage, you can determine what the input voltage is. Note: The 
generator is stiff when RG is less than 0.01 zin(stage) .310 Chapter 8

SOLUTION  Here are two quantities calculated in earlier examples: re9 5 22.7 V and AV 5 117. We will use these 
 values in solving the problem.
When /H9252 5 300, the input impedance of the base is:
zin(base)  5 (300)(22.7 V) 5 6.8 k V
The input impedance of the stage is:
zin(stage)  5 10 kV i 2.2 k V i 6.8 k V 5 1.42 k V
With Eq. (8-17), we can calculate the input voltage:
vin 5   1.42 k V  _______________   600 V 1 1.42 k V   2 mV  5 1.41 mV
This is the ac voltage that appears at the base of the transistor, equivalent to the ac voltage across the emitter diode. The 
amplifi  ed output voltage equals:
vout 5 AVvin 5 (117)(1.41 mV)  5 165 mV
PRACTICE PROBLEM 8-9   Change the RG value in Fig. 8-27 to 50 V and solve for the new amplifi  ed output voltage.
Example 8-10
Repeat the preceding example for /H9252 5 50.
SOLUTION  When /H9252 5 50, the input impedance of the base decreases to:
zin(base)  5 (50)(22.7 V) 5 1.14 k V
The input impedance of the stage decreases to:
zin(stage)  5 10 kV i 2.2 k V i 1.14 k V 5 698 V
With Eq. (8-27), we can calculate the input voltage:
vin 5   698 V _____________   600 V 1 698 V   2 mV  5 1.08 mVBasic BJT Ampliﬁ  ers 3118-11 Swamped Ampliﬁ  er
The voltage gain of a CE amplifi  er changes with the quiescent current, temperature 
variations, and transistor replacement because these quantities change r9e and  /H9252.
AC Emitter Feedback
One way to stabilize the voltage gain is to leave some of the emitter resistance 
 unbypassed, as shown in Fig. 8-28 a, producing ac emitter feedback.  When ac 
emitter current fl  ows through the unbypassed emitter resistance re, an ac voltage 
The output voltage equals:
vout 5 AVvin 5 (117)(1.08 mV)  5 126 mV
This example illustrates how the ac current gain of the transistor can change the output voltage. When /H9252  decreases, 
the input impedance of the base decreases, the input impedance of the stage decreases, the input voltage  decreases, and the 
output voltage decreases.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 8-10   Using Fig. 8-27, change the /H9252 value to 400 and calculate the output voltage.

poses changes in voltage gain. The unbypassed resistance re is called a feedback 
resistor  because it has an ac voltage across it that opposes changes in voltage gain.
For instance, suppose the ac collector current increases because of a 
 temperature increase. This will produce a larger output voltage, but it will also pro-
duce a larger ac voltage across re. Since vbe equals the difference between vin and ve, 
the increase in ve will decrease vbe. This decreases the ac collector current. Since this 
opposes the original increase in ac collector current, we have negative feedback.
Voltage Gain
Figure 8-28 b shows the ac-equivalent circuit with the T model of the transistor. 
Clearly, the ac emitter current must fl  ow through r9e and re. With Ohm’s law, we 
can write:
vin 5 ie(re 1 r9e) 5 vb
In the collector circuit, the current source pumps an ac current ic through the ac 
collector resistance. Therefore, the ac output voltage equals:
vout 5 icrc
Now, we can divide vout by vin to get:
AV 5   vout ___ vin   5   icre _________  ie(re 1 r9e)   5   vc __ vb  
Since ic < ie, we can simplify the equation to get:
AV /H11005   rc ______ re /H11001 r/H11032e   (8-18)
 When re is much greater than r9e, the foregoing equation simplifi  es to:
AV /H11005   rc __ re   (8-19)
This says that the voltage gain equals the ac collector resistance divided by the 
feedback resistance. Since r9e no longer appears in the equation for voltage gain, it 
no longer has an effect on the voltage gain.
The foregoing is an example of swamping,  making one quantity much 
larger than a second quantity to eliminate changes in the second. In Eq. (8-18), 
a large value of re swamps out the variations in r9e. The result is a stable voltage gain, 
one that does not change with temperature variation or transistor  replacement.
Input Impedance of the Base
The negative feedback not only stabilizes the voltage gain, it also increases the 
input impedance of the base. In Fig. 8-28 b, the input impedance of the base is:
zin(base)  5 vin/ib
Applying Ohm’s law to the emitter diode in Fig. 8-28 b, we can write:
vin 5 ie(re 1 r9e)
Substitute this equation into the preceding one to get:
zin(base)  5   vin ___ ib   5   ie(re 1 r9e) _________  ib  
Since ie < ic, the foregoing equation becomes:
zin(base)  /H11005 /H9252(re /H11001 r/H11032e) (8-20)
In a swamped amplifi  er, this simplifi  es to:
zin(base)  /H11005 /H9252re (8-21)Basic BJT Ampliﬁ  ers 313
This says that the input impedance of the base equals the current gain times the 
feedback resistance.
Less Distortion with Large Signals
The nonlinearity of the emitter-diode curve is the source of large-signal distortion. 
By swamping the emitter diode, we reduce the effect it has on voltage gain. In 
turn, this reduces the distortion that occurs for large-signal operation.
Put it this way: Without the feedback resistor, the voltage gain is:
AV 5   rc __ r9e  
Since r9e is current sensitive, its value changes when a large signal is present. This 
means that the voltage gain changes during the cycle of a large signal. In other 
words, changes in r9e are the cause of distortion with large signals.
With the feedback resistor, however, the swamped voltage gain is:
AV 5   rc __ re  
Since r9e is no longer present, the distortion of large signals has been eliminated. 
A  swamped amplifi  er, therefore, has three advantages: It stabilizes voltage gain, 
 increases the input impedance of the base, and reduces the distortion of large  signals.

and solve for the output voltage across the 10 k V load.
Application Example  8-12
Repeat the preceding example, but this time, include r9e in the calculations.
SOLUTION   The input impedance of the base is:
zin(base)  5 /H9252(re 1 re9) 5 (200)(180 V 1 22.7 V) 5 40.5 k V
The input impedance of the stage is:

The ac input voltage to the base is:

The voltage gain is:

The output voltage is:
vout 5 (13.1)(37 mV)  5 485 mV
 Comparing the results with and without r9e in the calculations, we can 
see that it has little effect on the fi  nal answer. This is to be expected in a swamped 
amplifi  er. When you are troubleshooting, you can assume that the amplifi  er is 
swamped when a feedback resistor is used in the emitter. If you need more accu-
racy, you can include r9e.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 8-12   Compare the calculated vout value to the 
measured value using Multisim.Basic BJT Ampliﬁ  ers 3158-12  Troubleshooting
When a single-stage amplifi  er is not working, a troubleshooter can start by meas-
uring dc voltages, including the dc power supply voltages. These voltages are 
estimated mentally as discussed earlier, and then the voltages are measured to see 
whether they are approximately correct. If the dc voltages are distinctly different 
from the estimated voltages, the possible troubles include open resistors (burned 
out), shorted resistors (solder bridges across them), incorrect wiring, shorted ca-
pacitors, and transistor failures. A short across a coupling or bypass  capacitor will 
change the dc-equivalent circuit, which means radically different dc voltages.
If all dc voltages measure OK, the troubleshooting is continued by 
considering what can go wrong in the ac-equivalent circuit. If there is genera-
tor  voltage but there is no ac base voltage, something may be open between the 
generator and the base. Perhaps a connecting wire is not in place, or maybe the 
input coupling capacitor is open. Similarly, if there is no fi  nal output voltage but 
there is an ac collector voltage, the output coupling capacitor may be open, or a 
connection may be missing.
Normally, there is no ac voltage between the emitter and ground when the 
emitter is at ac ground. When an amplifi  er is not working properly, one of the things 
a troubleshooter checks with an oscilloscope is the emitter voltage. If there is any ac 
voltage at a bypass emitter, it means that the bypass capacitor is not working.
For instance, an open bypass capacitor means that the emitter is no longer 
at ac ground. Because of this, the ac emitter current fl  ows through RE instead of 
through the bypass capacitor. This produces an ac emitter voltage, which you can 
see with an oscilloscope. So, if you see an ac emitter voltage comparable in size 
to the ac base voltage, check the emitter-bypass capacitor. It may be  defective or 
not properly connected.
Under normal conditions, the supply line is an ac ground point because 
of the fi  lter capacitor in the power supply. If the fi  lter capacitor is defective, the 
ripple becomes huge. This unwanted ripple gets to the base through the voltage 
 divider. Then it is amplifi  ed the same as the generator signal. This amplifi  ed ripple 
will produce a hum of 60 or 120 Hz when the amplifi  er is connected to a loud-
speaker. So, if you ever hear excessive hum coming out of a loudspeaker, one of 
the prime suspects is an open fi  lter capacitor in the power supply.
Example 8-13
The CE amplifi  er in Fig. 8-30 has an ac load voltage of zero. If the dc collector 
voltage is 6 V and the ac collector voltage is 70 mV , what is the trouble?
SOLUTION  Since the dc and ac collector voltages are normal, there are only 
two components that can be the trouble: C2 or RL. If you ask four what-if ques-
tions about these components, you can fi  nd the trouble. The four what-ifs are:
What if C2 is shorted?
What if C2 is open?
What if RL is shorted?
What if RL is open?
The answers are:
A shorted C2 decreases the dc collector voltage signifi  cantly.
  An open C2 breaks the ac path but does not change the dc or ac collector 
voltages.316 Chapter 8
A shorted RL kills the ac collector voltage.
An open RL increases the ac collector voltage signifi  cantly.

The trouble is an open C2. When you fi  rst learn how to troubleshoot, you may have 
to ask yourself what-if questions to isolate the trouble. After you gain  experience, 
the whole process becomes automatic. An experienced troubleshooter would have 
found this trouble almost instantly.
Example 8-14
The CE amplifi  er in Fig. 8-30 has an ac emitter voltage of 0.75 mV and an ac 
collector voltage of 2 mV. What is the trouble?
SOLUTION  Because troubleshooting is an art, you have to ask what-if 
questions that make sense to you and in any order that helps you to fi  nd the 
trouble. If you haven’t fi  gured out this trouble yet, start to ask what-if questions 
about each component and see whether you can fi  nd the trouble. Then read what 
comes next.
No matter which component you select, your what-if questions will not 
produce the symptoms given here until you start asking these  what-if questions:
What if C3 is shorted?
What if C3 is open?
A shorted C3 cannot produce the symptoms, but an open C3 does. Why?  Because 
with an open C3, the input impedance of the base is much higher and the ac 
base voltage increases from 0.625 to 0.75 mV. Since the emitter is no longer ac 
grounded, almost all this 0.75 mV appears at the emitter. Since the amplifi  er has 
a swamped voltage gain of 2.65, the ac collector voltage is approximately 2 mV.

   Summary
SEC. 8-1   BASE-BIASED 
AMPLIFIER
Good coupling occurs when the 
reactance of the coupling capacitor 
is much smaller than the resistance 
at the lowest frequency of the ac 
source. In a base-biased ampliﬁ  er, 
the input signal is coupled into the 
base. This produces an ac collector 
voltage. The ampliﬁ  ed and inverted 
ac collector voltage is then coupled 
to the load resistance.
SEC. 8-2   EMITTER-BIASED 
AMPLIFIER
Good bypassing occurs when the 
reactance of the coupling capacitor 
is much smaller than the resistance 
at the lowest frequency of the ac 
source. The bypassed point is an ac 
ground. With either a VDB or a TSEB 
ampliﬁ  er, the ac signal is coupled into 
the base. The ampliﬁ  ed ac signal is 
then coupled to the load resistance.
SEC. 8-3   SMALL-SIGNAL 
OPERATION
The ac base voltage has a dc 
component and an ac component. 
These set up dc and ac  components 
of emitter current. One way to 
avoid  excessive distortion is to use 
small-signal operation. This means 
keeping the peak-to-peak ac emitter 
current less than one-tenth of the dc 
emitter current.
SEC. 8-4  AC BETA
The ac beta of a transistor is deﬁ  ned 
as the ac collector current divided by 
the ac base current. The values of 
the ac beta usually diff  er only slightly 
from the values of the dc beta. When troubleshooting, you can use the 
same value for either beta. On data 
sheets, hFE is equivalent to /H9252dc, and 
hfe is equivalent to /H9252.
SEC. 8-5   AC RESISTANCE OF 
THE EMITTER DIODE
The base-emitter voltage of a tran-
sistor has a dc component VBEQ and 
an ac component vbe. The ac base- 
emitter voltage sets up an ac emitter 
current of ie. The ac resistance of 
the emitter diode is deﬁ  ned as vbe 
divided by ie. With mathematics, we 
can prove that the ac resistance 
of the emitter diode equals 25 mV 
 divided by the dc emitter current.
SEC. 8-6   TWO TRANSISTOR 
MODELS
As far as ac signals are concerned, 
a transistor can be replaced by ei-
ther of two equivalent circuits: the /H9266 
model or the T model. The /H9266 model 
indicates that the input impedance of 
the base is  /H9252r9e.
SEC. 8-7   ANALYZING AN 
AMPLIFIER
The simplest way to analyze an am-
pliﬁ  er is to split the analysis into two 
parts: a dc analysis and an ac analy-
sis. In the dc analysis, the capacitors 
are open. In the ac analysis, the 
capacitors are shorted and the dc 
supply points are ac grounds.
SEC. 8-8   AC QUANTITIES ON 
THE DATA SHEET
The h parameters are used on data 
sheets because they are easier to 
measure than r9 parameters. The r9 param eters are easier to use in anal-
ysis because we can use Ohm’s law 
and other basic ideas. The most im-
portant quantities on the data sheet 
are hfe and hie. They can be easily 
converted into /H9252 and r9e.
SEC. 8-9   VOLTAGE GAIN
The voltage gain of a CE ampliﬁ  er 
equals the ac collector resistance 
divided by the ac resistance of the 
emitter diode.
SEC. 8-10   THE LOADING 
 EFFECT OF INPUT 
IMPEDANCE
The input impedance of the stage 
includes the biasing resistors and 
the input impedance of the base. 
When the source is not stiff   com-
pared to this input impedance, the 
input voltage is less than the source 
voltage.
SEC. 8-11   SWAMPED 
AMPLIFIER
By leaving some of the emitter resist-
ance unbypassed, we get negative 
feedback. This stabilizes the voltage 
gain, increases the input impedance, 
and reduces large-signal distortion.
SEC. 8-12   TROUBLESHOOTING
With single-stage ampliﬁ  ers, start 
with dc measurements. If they do 
not  isolate the trouble, you continue 
with ac measurements until you have 
found the trouble.318 Chapter 8(8-5)  Good bypassing:

Critical Thinking

builder cannot understand why a very small dc 
voltage is measured across the 10 k V when the 
source is 2 V at zero frequency. Can you explain 
what is happening?
8-36  Assume that you are in the laboratory testing the 
circuit in Fig. 8-32. As you increase the frequency 
of the generator, the voltage at node A decreases 
until it becomes too small to measure. If you con-
tinue to increase the frequency well above 10 MHz, 
the voltage at node A begins to increase. Can you 
explain why this happens?8-37  In Fig. 8-33, the Thevenin resistance seen by the

Ampliﬁ  ers
When the load resistance is small compared to the collector 
resistance, the voltage gain of a CE stage becomes small and 
the ampliﬁ  er may become overloaded. One way to prevent 
overloading is to use a common-collector (CC) ampliﬁ  er 
or emitter follower. This type of ampliﬁ  er has a large input 
impedance and can drive small load resistances. In addition to 
emitter followers, this chapter discusses multistage ampliﬁ  ers, 
Darlington ampliﬁ  ers, improved voltage regulation, and 
common-base (CB) ampliﬁ  ers.

Ampliﬁ  ers328 Chapter 99-1 Multistage Ampliﬁ  ers
To get more voltage gain, we can create a multistage amplifi  er by cascading  two 
or more amplifi  er stages. This means using the output of the fi  rst stage as the input 
to a second stage. In turn, the output of the second stage can be used as the input to 
the third stage, and so on.
 Figure 9-1 a shows a two-stage amplifi  er. The amplifi  ed and inverted sig-
nal out of the fi  rst stage is coupled to the base of the second stage. The amplifi  ed 
and  inverted output of the second stage is then coupled to the load resistance. The 
 signal across the load resistance is in phase with the generator signal. The reason 
is that each stage inverts the signal by 180°. Therefore, two stages invert the  signal 
by 360°, equivalent to 0° (in phase).
Voltage Gain of First Stage
Figure 9-1 b shows the ac-equivalent circuit. Note that the input impedance of the 
second stage loads down the fi  rst stage. In other words, the zin of the second stage 
is in parallel with the RC of the fi  rst stage. The ac collector resistance of the fi  rst 
stage is:
rc 5 RC i zin(stage)

and the voltage gain is:

Total Voltage Gain
The total voltage gain  of the amplifi  er is given by the product of the individual 
gains:
AV 5 (AV1)(AV2) (9-1)
For instance, if each stage has a voltage gain of 50, the overall voltage gain is 2500.

SOLUTION  From earlier dc calculations:
VB 5 1.8 V

VCE 5 4.94 V
IE 5 1.1 mA
re9 5 22.7 ohms
The input impedance of the fi  rst base is:
zin(base)  5 (100)(22.7 V) 5 2.27 k V
The input impedance of the fi  rst stage is:
zin(stage)  5 10 kV i 2.2 k V i 2.27 k V 5 1 kV330 Chapter 9
The input signal to the fi  rst base is:
vin 5   1 kV ____________   600 V 1 1 kV   1 mV 5 0.625 mV
The input impedance of the second base is the same as the fi  rst stage:
zin(stage)  5 10 kV i 2.2 k V i 2.27 k V 5 1 kV
This input impedance is the load resistance of the fi  rst stage. In other words, the ac collector resistance of the fi  rst stage is:

The voltage gain of the fi  rst stage is:

Therefore, the ac collector voltage of the fi  rst stage is:

The ac collector resistance of the second stage is:

A swamped amplifi  er is an example of single-stage feedback. It works reasonably 
well to stabilize the voltage gain, increase the input impedance, and reduce distor-
tion. Two-stage feedback  works even better.
Basic Idea
Figure 9-4 shows a two-stage feedback amplifi  er. The fi  rst stage has an unby-
passed emitter resistance of re. This fi  rst stage is often referred to as a preamplfi  er. 
and the voltage gain of the fi  rst stage is:
AV1 5   1.16 k V _______ 180 V   5 6.44
The amplifi  ed and inverted ac voltage at the fi  rst collector and the second base is:
vc 5 (6.44)(0.74 mV)  5 4.77 mV
The ac collector resistance of the second stage is:
 rc 5 RC i RL 5 3.6 k V i 10 k V 5 2.65 k V 
Therefore, it has a voltage gain of:
AV2 5   2.65 k V _______ 180 V   5 14.7
The fi  nal output voltage equals:
vout 5 (14.7)(4.77 mV)  5 70 mV
 Another way to calculate the output voltage is to use the overall voltage gain:
AV 5 (AV1)(AV2) 5 (6.44)(14.7)  5 95
Then:

Q1 Q2Figure 9-3  Two-stage swamped ampliﬁ  er example.332 Chapter 9It is used to pick up the input signal from the source, without loading down the 
source, and to pass on the signal to the second stage for further amplifi  cation. The 
second stage is a CE stage, with the emitter at ac ground to produce maximum 
gain in this stage. The output signal is coupled back through a feedback resistance 
rf to the fi  rst emitter. Because of the voltage  divider, the ac voltage between the 
fi  rst emitter and ground is:
ve 5   re ______ rf 1 re   vout
 Here is the basic idea of how the two-stage feedback works: Assume 
that an increase in temperature causes the output voltage to increase. Since 
part of the output voltage is fed back to the fi  rst emitter, ve increases. This de-
creases vbe in the fi  rst stage, decreases vc in the fi  rst stage, and decreases vout. 
On the other hand, if the output voltage tries to decrease, vbe increases and vout 
 increases.
 In either case, any attempted change in the output voltage is fed back, 
and the amplifi  ed change opposes the original change. The overall effect is that 
the output voltage will change by a much smaller amount than it would without 
the negative feedback.
Voltage Gain
In a well-designed two-stage feedback amplifi  er, the voltage gain is given by this 
derivation:
AV 5   rf __ re   1 1 (9-2)
In most designs, the fi  rst term in this equation is much greater than 1, so the equa-
tion simplifi  es to:
AV 5   rf __ re  
When we discuss op amps, we will analyze negative feedback in detail. At that 
time, you will see what is meant by a well-designed feedback amplifi  er.
 What’s important about Eq. (9-2) is this: The voltage gain depends only 
on external resistances  rf and re. Since these resistances are fi  xed in value, the 
voltage gain is fi  xed.R4

PRACTICE PROBLEM 9-3   In Fig. 9-5, what value of resistance would the variable resistor need to be for a voltage 
gain of 50?
Application Example 9-4
How could the circuit in Fig. 9-5 be modifi  ed for use as a portable microphone preamplifi  er?
SOLUTION   The 10-V dc power supply could be replaced with a 9-V battery and on/off switch. Connect a properly 
sized microphone jack to the preamplifi  er’s input coupling capacitor and ground. The microphone should ideally be a 
low-impedance dynamic style. If an electret microphone is used, it will be  necessary to power it from the 9-V battery through 
a series resistor. For good low-frequency response, the coupling and bypass capacitors need to have low capacitive reactance. 
A value of 47 /H9262F for each coupling capacitor and 100 /H9262F for each bypass capacitor can be used. The 10-k V output load can 
be changed to a 10-k V potentiometer to vary the output level. If more voltage gain is needed, change the 10-k V feedback 
potentiometer to a higher value. The output should be able to drive the line/CD/aux/tape inputs of a home stereo amplifi  er. 
Check your system’s specifi  cations for the proper input needed. Placing all components in a small metal box and using 
shielded cables will reduce external noise and  interference.334 Chapter 99-3 CC Ampliﬁ  er
The emitter follower  is also called a common-collector (CC) amplifi  er. The 
input signal is coupled to the base, and the output signal is taken from the emitter.
Basic Idea
Figure 9-6 a shows an emitter follower. Because the collector is at ac ground, the 
circuit is a CC amplifi  er. The input voltage is coupled to the base. This sets up an 
ac emitter current and produces an ac voltage across the emitter resistor. This ac 
voltage is then coupled to the load resistor.
 Figure 9-6 b shows the total voltage between the base and ground. It has 
a dc component and an ac component. As you can see, the ac input voltage rides 
on the quiescent base voltage VBQ. Similarly, Fig. 9-6 c shows the total voltage 
between the emitter and ground. This time, the ac input voltage is centered on a 
quiescent emitter voltage VEQ.
 The ac emitter voltage is coupled to the load resistor. This output volt-
age is shown in Fig. 9-6 d, a pure ac voltage. This output voltage is in phase and

emitter follower  is because the output voltage follows the input voltage.
 Since there is no collector resistor, the total voltage between the collector 
and ground equals the supply voltage. If you look at the collector voltage with 
an oscilloscope, you will see a constant dc voltage like Fig. 9-6 e. There is no ac 
signal on the collector because it is an ac ground point.
Negative Feedback
Like a swamped amplifi  er, the emitter follower uses negative feedback. But 
with the emitter follower, the negative feedback is massive because the feed-
back resistance equals all of the emitter resistance. As a result, the voltage gain is 
ultrastable, the distortion is almost nonexistent, and the input impedance of the base 
is very high. Because of these characteristics, the emitter follower is often used as 
a preamplifi  er. The trade-off is the voltage gain, which has a maximum value of 1.
AC Emitter Resistance
In Fig. 9-6 a, the ac signal coming out of the emitter sees RE in parallel with RL. 
Let us defi  ne the ac emitter resistance as follows:
re 5 RE i RL (9-3)
This is the external ac emitter resistance, which is different from the internal ac 
emitter resistance re9.
Voltage Gain
Figure 9-7 a shows the ac-equivalent with the T model. Using Ohm’s law, we can 
write these two equations:
vout 5 iere
 vin 5 ie(re 1 re9)
Divide the fi  rst equation by the second, and you get the voltage gain of the  emitter 
follower:
AV 5   re ______ re 1 r9e   (9-4)
Usually, a designer makes re much greater than r9e so that the voltage gain equals 
1 (approximately). This is the value to use for all preliminary analysis and 
 troubleshooting.GOOD TO KNOW
In some emitter-follower circuits, 
a small collector resistance is 
used to limit the dc collector 
current in the transistor in case 
a short occurs between the 
emitter and ground. If a small 
RC is used, the collector will 
have a bypass capacitor going 
to ground. The small value of RC
will have only a slight bearing 
on the dc operation of the circuit 
and no bearing at all on the cir-
cuit’s ac operation.

(a)re/H11032Figure 9-7  AC-equivalent circuits for emitter follower.336 Chapter 9 Why is an emitter follower called an amplifi  er if its voltage gain is only 1? 
Because it has a current gain of /H9252. The stages near the end of a system need to pro-
duce more current because the fi  nal load is usually a low impedance. The emitter 
follower can produce the large output currents needed by low-impedance loads. 
In short, although it is not a voltage amplifi  er, the emitter follower is a current or 
power amplifi  er.
Input Impedance of the Base
Figure 9-7 b shows the ac-equivalent circuit with the /H9266 model of the transistor. As 
far as the input impedance of the base is concerned, the action is the same as that of 
a swamped amplifi  er. The current gain transforms the total emitter resistance up by 
a factor of /H9252. The derivation is therefore identical to that of a swamped amplifi  er:
zin(base)  5 /H9252(re 1 r9e) (9-5)
For troubleshooting, you can assume that re is much greater than r9e, which means 
that the input impedance is approximately /H9252re.
 The step-up in impedance is the major advantage of an emitter follower. 
Small load resistances that would overload a CE amplifi  er can be used with an 
emitter follower because it steps up the impedance and prevents overloading.
Input Impedance of the Stage
When the ac source is not stiff, some of the ac signal will be lost across the inter-
nal resistance. If you want to calculate the effect of the internal resistance, you 
will need to use the input impedance of the stage, given by:
zin(stage)  5 R1 i R2 i /H9252(re 1 re9) (9-6)
With the input impedance and the source resistance, you can use the voltage 
divider to calculate the input voltage reaching the base. The calculations are the 
same as shown in earlier chapters.GOOD TO KNOW
In Fig. 9-8, the biasing resistors 
R1 and R2 lower zin to a value 
that is not much different from 
that of a swamped CE amplifier. 
This disadvantage is overcome 
in most emitter-follower designs 
by simply not using the biasing 
resistors R1 and R2. Instead, the 
emitter-follower is dc biased 
by the stage driving the emitter 
follower.

SOLUTION  Because each resistance in the voltage divider is 10 k V, the dc 
base voltage is half the supply voltage, or 5 V . The dc emitter voltage is 0.7 V less, 
or 4.3 V . The dc emitter voltage is 4.3 V divided by 4.3 k V, or 1 mA. Therefore,

The output impedance of an amplifi  er is the same as its Thevenin impedance. One 
of the advantages of an emitter follower is its low output impedance.
 As discussed in earlier electronics courses, maximum power transfer oc-
curs when the load impedance is matched  (made equal) to the source (Thevenin) 
impedance. Sometimes, when maximum load power is wanted, a designer can 
match the load impedance to the output impedance of an emitter follower. For 
instance, the low impedance of a speaker can be matched to the output impedance 
of an emitter follower to deliver maximum power to the speaker.
Basic Idea
Figure 9-11 a shows an ac generator driving an amplifi  er. If the source is not 
stiff, some of the ac voltage is dropped across the internal resistance RG. In this 
case, we need to analyze the voltage divider shown in Fig. 9-11 b to get the input 
 voltage vin.
 A similar idea can be used with the output side of the amplifi  er. In 
Fig. 9-11 c, we can apply the Thevenin theorem at the load terminals. Looking back 
into the amplifi  er, we see an output impedance zout. In the Thevenin-equivalent 
circuit, this output impedance forms a voltage divider with the load resistance, as 
shown in Fig. 9-11 d. If zout is much smaller than RL, the output source is stiff and 
vout equals vth.
CE Ampliﬁ  ers

fi er depends on RC, a designer cannot make RC too small without losing voltage 
gain. Stated another way, it is diffi  cult to get a small output impedance with a 
CE amplifi  er. Because of this, CE amplifi  ers are not suited to driving small load 
resistances.
Emitter Follower
Figure 9-13 a shows the ac-equivalent circuit for an emitter follower. When we 
apply Thevenin’s theorem to point A, we get Fig. 9-13 b. The output impedance 
zout is much smaller than you can get with a CE amplifi  er. It equals:
zout 5 RE i  ( r9e 1   RGiR1iR2 __________  /H9252   )  (9-7)
 The impedance of the base circuit is RG i R1 i R2. The current gain of the 
transistor steps this impedance down by a factor of /H9252. The effect is similar to what 
we get with a swamped amplifi  er, except that we are moving from the base back 
to the emitter. Therefore, we get a reduction of impedance rather than an increase. 
The stepped-down impedance of ( RG i R1 i R2)//H9252 is in series with re9 as indicated 
by Eq. (9-7).
Ideal Action
In some designs, the biasing resistances and the ac resistance of the emitter diode 
become negligible. In this case, the output impedance of an emitter follower can 
be approximated by:
zout 5   RG ___ b   (9-8)
This brings out the key idea of an emitter follower: It steps the impedance of the 
ac source down by a factor of /H9252. As a result, the emitter follower allows us to build GOOD TO KNOW

for:
zout ,, RL    (Stiff v oltage s ource)
the designer will select values to get:
zout 5 RL    (Maximum po wer tra nsfer)
In this way, the emitter follower can deliver maximum power to a low-impedance 
load such as a stereo speaker. By basically removing the effect of RL on the output 
voltage, the circuit is acting as a buffer between the input and output.
 Equation (9-8) is an ideal formula. You can use it to get an approximate 
value for the output impedance of an emitter follower. With discrete circuits, the 
equation usually gives only an estimate of the output impedance. Nevertheless, it 
is adequate for troubleshooting and preliminary analysis. When necessary, you 
can use Eq. (9-7) to get an accurate value for the output impedance.
Example 9-8
Estimate the output impedance of the emitter follower in Fig. 9-14 a.
SOLUTION  Ideally, the output impedance equals the generator resistance 
 divided by the current gain of the transistor:
zout 5   600V _____ 300   5 2 V
Figure 9-14 b shows the equivalent output circuit. The output impedance is much 
smaller than the load resistance, so most of the signal appears across the load re-
sistor. As you can see, the output source of Fig. 9-14 b is almost stiff  because the 
ratio of load to source resistance is 50.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 9-8   Using Fig. 9-14, change the source resistance 
to 1 k V and solve for the approximate zout value.
Example 9-9
Calculate the output impedance in Fig. 9-14 a using Eq. (9-7).
SOLUTION  The quiescent base voltage is approximately:
VBQ 5 15 V
Ignoring VBE, the quiescent emitter current is approximately:
IEQ 5   15V ______ 100 V   5 150 mA
The ac resistance of the emitter diode is:
re9 5   25 mV _______ 150 mA   5 0.167 V
The impedance seen looking back from the base is:
RG i R1 i R2 5 600 V i 10 k V i 10 k V 5 536 V342 Chapter 9
The current gain steps this down to:
RG i R1 i R2 __________  /H9252   5   536 V ______ 300   5 1.78 V
This is in series with re9, so the impedance looking back into the emitter is:
r9e 1   RG i R1 i R2 __________  /H9252   5 0.167 V 1 1.78 V 5 1.95 V
This is in parallel with the dc emitter resistance, so the output impedance is:
zout 5 RE i 1r9e 1   RG i R1 i R2 __________  /H9252  2 5 100 V i 1.95 V 5 1.91 V
 This accurate answer is extremely close to the ideal answer of 2  V. This 
result is typical of many designs. For all troubleshooting and  preliminary analysis, 
you can use the ideal method to estimate the output  impedance.

9-5 Cascading CE and CC
To illustrate the buffering action of a CC amplifi  er, suppose we have a load resist-
ance of 270 V. If we try to couple the output of a CE amplifi  er directly into this 
load resistance, we may overload the amplifi  er. One way to avoid this overload 
is by using an emitter follower between the CE amplifi  er and the load resistance. 
The signal can be coupled capacitively (this means through coupling capacitors), 
or it may be direct coupled  as shown in Fig. 9-15.
 As you can see, the base of the second transistor is connected directly 
to the collector of the fi  rst transistor. Because of this, the dc collector voltage Multistage, CC, and CB Ampliﬁ  ers 343of the fi  rst transistor is used to bias the second transistor. If the dc current gain of 
the  second transistor is 100, the dc resistance looking into the base of the second 
transistor is Rin 5 100 (270 V) 5 27 k V.
 Because 27 k V is large compared to 3.6 k V, the dc collector voltage of 
the fi  rst stage is only slightly disturbed.
 In Fig. 9-15, the amplifi  ed voltage out of the fi  rst stage drives the emitter 
follower and appears across the fi  nal load resistance of 270 V. Without the emitter 
follower, the 270 V would overload the fi  rst stage. But with the emitter follower, 
its impedance effect is increased by a factor of /H9252. Instead of appearing like 270 V, 
it now looks like 27 k V in both the dc- and the ac-equivalent circuits.
 This demonstrates how an emitter follower can act as a buffer  between a 
high-output impedance and a low-resistance load.
 This example shows you the effects of overloading a CE amplifi  er. The 
load  resistance should be much greater than the dc collector resistance to get 
 maximum voltage gain. We have just the opposite; the load resistance (270 V) is 
much smaller than the dc collector resistance (3.6 k V).vgLoad

voltage is 1.1 V . The dc emitter current is IE 5   1.1 V ______ 680 V   5 1.61 mA and the ac 
resistance of the emitter diode is r9e 5   25 mV ________ 1.61 mA   5 15.5 V. Next, we need to
calculate the input impedance of the emitter follower. Since there are no biasing 
resistors, the input impedance equals the input impedance looking into the base: 
zin 5 (100)(270 V) 5 27 k V. The ac collector resistance of the CE amplifi  er is 
rc 5 3.6 k V i 27 k V 5 3.18 k V and the voltage gain of this stage is: 
Av 5   3.18 k V _______ 15.5 V   5 205
PRACTICE PROBLEM 9-10   Using Fig. 9-15, fi  nd the voltage gain of the 
CE stage for a /H9252 of 300.344 Chapter 9
Application Example 9-11
Suppose the emitter follower is removed in Fig. 9-15 and a capacitor is used to 
couple the ac signal to the 270- V load resistor. What happens to the voltage gain 
of the CE amplifi  er?
SOLUTION   The value of r9e remains the same for the CE stage: 15.5 V. But 
the ac collector resistance is much lower. To begin with, the ac collector resistance 
is the parallel resistance of 3.6 k V and 270 V: rc 5 3.6 k V i 270 V 5 251 V. 
Because this is much lower, the voltage gain decreases to: 
Av 5   251 V ______ 15.5 V   5 16.2.

load resistance of 100 V.
9-6 Darlington Connections
A Darlington connection  is a connection of two transistors whose overall current 
gain equals the product of the individual current gains. Since its current gain is 
much higher, a Darlington connection can have a very high input impedance and 
can produce very large output currents. Darlington connections are often used with 
voltage regulators, power amplifi  ers, and high current switching applications.
Darlington Pair
Figure 9-16 a shows a Darlington pair . Since the emitter current of Q1 is the base 
current for Q2, the Darlington pair has an overall current gain of:
b 5b1b2 (9-9)
For instance, if each transistor has a current gain of 200, the overall current gain is:
/H9252 5 (200)(200)  5 40,000
 Semiconductor manufacturers can put a Darlington pair inside a single 
case like that shown in Fig. 9-16 b. This device, known as a Darlington transistor,
acts like a single transistor with a very high current gain. For instance, the 2N6725 
is a  Darlington transistor with a current gain of 25,000 at 200 mA. As another ex-
ample, the TIP102 is a power Darlington with a current gain of 1000 at 3 A.
 This is shown in the data sheet in Fig. 9-17. Notice that this device uses 
a TO-220 case style and has built-in base-emitter shunt resistors, along with an

testing this device with an ohmmeter.
 The analysis of a circuit using a Darlington transistor is almost identical 
to the emitter-follower analysis. With the Darlington transistor, since there are 
two transistors, there are two VBE drops. The base current of Q2 is the same as the 
emitter current of Q1. Also, using Eq. 9-9, the input impedance at the base of Q1
can be found by zin(base)  > /H92521/H92522re or stated as: 
zin(base)  > bre  (9-10)

PRACTICE PROBLEM 9-12   Repeat Example 9-12 using a Darlington 
pair with each transistor having a current gain of 75.
Complementary Darlington
Figure 9-16 c shows another Darlington connection called a complementary 
 Darlington,  a connection of npn and pnp transistors. The collector current of Q1
is the base current of Q2. If the pnp transistor has a current gain of /H92521 and the npn
output transistor has a current gain of /H92522 the complementary Darlington acts like 
a single pnp transistor with a current gain of /H92521/H92522.
 Npn  and pnp Darlington transistors can be manufactured to be comple-
ments to each other. As an example, the TIP105/106/107 pnp Darlington series is 
complementary to the TIP/101/102 npn series.
9-7 Voltage Regulation
Besides being used in buffer circuits and impedance matching amplifi  ers, the 
emitter follower is widely used in voltage regulators. In conjunction with a zener 
diode, the emitter follower can produce regulated output voltages with much 
larger output currents.
Zener Follower
Figure 9-19 a shows a zener follower,  a circuit that combines a zener regulator 
and an emitter follower. Here is how it works: The zener voltage is the input to 
the base of the emitter follower. The dc output voltage of the emitter follower is:
Vout 5 VZ 2 VBE (9-11)
This output voltage is fi  xed so that it is equal to the zener voltage minus 
the VBE drop of the transistor. If the supply voltage changes, the zener voltage GOOD TO KNOW
The complementary Darling-
ton transistor in Fig. 9-16 c was 
originally developed because 
complementary high-power 
transistors were not readily 
available. The complementary 
transistor is often used in a 
special stage known as a quasi-
complementary output stage.
GOOD TO KNOW
In Fig. 9-19, the emitter-follower 
circuit reduces the zener cur-
rent variations by a factor of /H9252 if 
you compare the zener current 
variations that would exist if the 
transistor were not there.

(b)RLRZ+re/H11032

–+Figure 9-19  (a) Zener follower; ( b) ac-equivalent circuit.348 Chapter 9 remains approximately constant, and so does the output voltage. In other words, 
the circuit acts like a voltage regulator because the output voltage is always one 
VBE drop less than the zener voltage.
 The zener follower has two advantages over an ordinary zener regulator: 
First, the zener diode in Fig. 9-19 a has to produce a load current of only:
IB 5   Iout ___ bdc   (9-12)
Since this base current is much smaller than the output current, we can use a much 
smaller zener diode.
 For instance, if you are trying to supply several amperes to a load 
 resistor, an ordinary zener regulator requires a zener diode capable of handling 
several amperes. On the other hand, with the improved regulator in Fig. 9-19 a, 
the zener diode needs to handle only tens of milliamperes.
 The second advantage of a zener follower is its low output impedance. In 
an ordinary zener regulator, the load resistor sees an output impedance of approx-
imately RZ, the zener impedance. But in the zener follower, the output impedance 
is:
zout 5 r9e 1   RZ ___ bdc   (9-13)
 Figure 9-19 b shows the equivalent output circuit. Because zout is usually 
very small compared to RL, an emitter follower can hold the dc output voltage 
almost constant because the source looks stiff.
 In summary, the zener follower provides the regulation of a zener diode 
with the increased current-handling capability of an emitter follower.
Two-Transistor Regulator
Figure 9-20 shows another voltage regulator. The dc input voltage Vin comes from 
an unregulated power supply, such as a bridge rectifi  er with a capacitor-input fi  l-
ter. Typically, Vin has a peak-to-peak ripple of about 10 percent of the dc voltage. 
The fi  nal output voltage Vout has almost no ripple and is almost constant in value, 
even though the input voltage and load current may vary over a large range.
 How does it work? Any attempted change in output voltage produces an 
amplifi  ed feedback voltage that opposes the original change. For instance, sup-
pose the output voltage increases. Then, the voltage appearing at the base of Q1 
will increase. Since Q1 and R2 form a CE amplifi  er, the collector voltage of Q1 will 
decrease because of the voltage gain.
 Since the collector voltage of Q1 has decreased, the base voltage of Q2 
 decreases. Because Q2 is an emitter follower, the output voltage will decrease. In

produces an opposing decrease in output voltage. The overall effect is that the output 
voltage will increase only slightly, much less than it would without the negative 
feedback.
 Conversely, if the output voltage tries to decrease, less voltage appears at 
the Q1 base, more voltage appears at the Q1 collector, and more voltage appears 
at the Q2 emitter. Again, we have a returning voltage that opposes the original 
change in output voltage. Therefore, the output voltage will decrease only a little, 
far less than without the negative feedback.
 Because of the zener diode, the Q1 emitter voltage equals VZ. The Q1
base voltage is one VBE drop higher. Therefore, the voltage across R4 is:
V4 5 VZ 1 VBE
With Ohm’s law, the current through R4 is:
I4 5   VZ 1 VBE  _________  R4  
Since this current fl  ows through R3 in series with R4, the output voltage is:
Vout 5 I4(R3 1 R4)
After expanding:
Vout 5   R3 1 R4 _______  R4   (VZ 1 VBE) (9-14)

9-8 The Common-Base Ampliﬁ  er
Figure 9-23 a shows a common-base (CB) amplifi  er using a dual polarity 
or split power supply. Since the base is grounded, this circuit is also called a 
grounded-based amplifi  er. The Q point is set by emitter bias, as shown by the Multistage, CC, and CB Ampliﬁ  ers 351Figure 9-23  CB ampliﬁ  er. ( a) Split supply; ( b) emitter-biased dc-equivalent

dc-equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 9-23 b. Therefore, the dc emitter current is

Figure 9-23 c shows a voltage-divider bias CB amplifi  er using a single power 
supply source. Notice the bypass capacitor across R2. This places the base at ac 
ground. By drawing the dc-equivalent circuit, as shown in Fig. 9-23 d, you should 
recognize the voltage-divider bias confi  guration.
 In either amplifi  er, the base is at ac ground. The input signal drives the 
emitter, and the output signal is taken from the collector. Figure 9-24 a shows the 
ac-equivalent circuit of a CB amplifi  er during the positive half-cycle of input volt-
age. In this circuit, the ac collector voltage, or vout, equals:
vout > icrc352 Chapter 9vout
RE vinre/H11032ie
icRC RL+
–Figure 9-24  Ac-equivalent circuit.
 This is in phase with the ac input voltage ve. Since the input voltage equals:
vin 5 ier/H11032e
 The voltage gain is:
Av 5   vout ___ vin   5   ic rc ____ ie r/H11032e  
 because ic > ie, the equation simplifi  es to: 
Av 5   rc __ r9e   (9-16)
 Notice that the voltage gain has the same magnitude as it would in an 
unswamped CE amplifi  er. The only difference is the phase of the output voltage. 
Whereas the output signal of a CE amplifi  er is 180° out of phase with the input 
signal, the output voltage of the CB amplifi  er is in phase with the input signal.
 Ideally, the collector current source in Fig. 9-24 has an infi  nite internal 
impedance. Therefore, the output impedance of a CB amplifi  er is: 
zout > RC (9-17)
 One of the major differences between the CB amplifi  er and other 
 amplifi  er confi  gurations is its low input impedance. Looking into the emitter of 
Fig. 9-24, we have an input impedance of:
 z in(emitter)  5   ve __ ie   5   ier9e  ____ ie     or  zin(emitter)  5 r9e
The input impedance of the circuit is: 
 z in 5 RE i r9e
 Since RE is normally much larger than r9e, the circuit input impedance is 
approximately:
 z in > r9e (9-18)
 As an example, if IE 5 1 mA, the input impedance of a CB amplifi  er is 
only 25 V. Unless the input ac source is very small, most of the signal will be lost 
across the source resistance.
 The input impedance of a CB amplifi  er is normally so low that it over-
loads most signal sources. Because of this, a discrete CB amplifi  er is not used too 
often at low frequencies. It is mainly used in high-frequency applications (above 
10 MHz) where low source impedances are common. Also, at high frequencies, 
the base separates the input and output, resulting in fewer oscillations at these 
 frequencies.
 An emitter-follower circuit was used in applications where a high 
 impedance source needed to drive a low impedance load. Just the opposite, a 
common-base circuit can be used to couple a low impedance source to a high 
 impedance loa d.Multistage, CC, and CB Ampliﬁ  ers 353

Ampliﬁ  ers
When an amplifi  er consists of two or more stages, what techniques can be fol-
lowed to effi  ciently troubleshoot the problem? In a single-stage amplifi  er, you can 
start by measuring the dc voltages, including the power supply voltages. When 
an amplifi  er consists of two or more stages, measuring all of the dc voltages, as a 
starting point, is not very effi  cient.
 In a multistage amplifi  er, it is best to isolate the defective stage fi  rst by 
using signal tracing or signal injection techniques. As an example, if the amplifi  er 
consists of four stages, split the amplifi  er in half by either measuring or injecting a 
signal at the output of the second stage. By doing so, you should be able to deter-
mine if the trouble is either before or after this circuit point. If the measured signal 
at the output of the second stage is proper, this verifi  es that the fi  rst two stages are 
working correct and that the problem must be in one of the next two stages. Now, 
move your next troubleshooting point to the midpoint of the remaining stages. 
This split-half method of troubleshooting can quickly isolate a defective stage.
 Once the defective stage is identifi  ed, now you can measure the dc volt-
ages to see if they are approximately correct. If these dc voltages are found to be 
correct, then further troubleshooting is continued by determining what has gone 
wrong with the ac-equivalent circuit. This type of failure is often an open coupling 
or bypass capacitor.
 As a fi  nal point, in multistage amplifi  ers the output of a stage will be 
loaded by the input of the next stage. A failure in the input side of stage two can 
have a negative effect at the output of stage one. Sometimes, it will be necessary 
to physically create an open between two stages to verify if there is a loading 
problem.Summary Table 9-1 (continued)

Application Example 9-16
What is the problem with the two-stage amplifi  er in Fig. 9-26?
SOLUTION   Examining Fig. 9-26, the fi  rst stage circuit is a CE preamplifi  er which takes an input signal from the signal 
source, amplifi  es it and passes it on to the second stage. The second stage, also a CE, amplifi  es the output of Q1 and couples 
the output of Q2 to the load resistor. In Example 9-2, we calculated the ac voltages to be:
vin 5 0.74 mV
vc 5 4.74 mV (output of the fi  rst stage)
vout 5 70 mV
These are the approximate ac voltages that you should measure when the amplifi  er is working correctly. (Sometimes, ac and 
dc voltages values are given on schematic diagrams used for troubleshooting.)
 Now, when connecting and measuring the circuit’s output voltage, the output signal across the 10 kΩ load is only 
13 mV . The measured input voltage is normal at approximately 0.74 mV . What measurements should you take next?
 Using the split-half signal tracing method, measure the ac voltage at the amplifi  er’s midpoint. When doing so, the 
output voltage at the collector of Q1 and the input voltage at the base of Q2 measures 4.90 mV , slightly higher than normal. 
This measurement verifi  es that the fi  rst stage is working properly. Therefore, the problem must be with stage two. 
 Measurements of the dc voltages at the base, emitter and collector of Q2 all measure normal. This indicates that the 
stage is operating correctly dc wise and must have an ac circuit problem. What could cause this to happen? Further ac meas-
urements show that a signal level of approximately 4 mV across the 820 Ω resistor RE2. Removal and testing of the bypass 
capacitor across RE2 verifi  es that it has opened. This failed capacitor caused the gain of stage two to signifi  cantly drop. Also, 
the open capacitor caused the input impedance of stage two to increase. This increase was the reason that the output signal 
of the fi  rst stage was slightly higher than normal.
 Whether the amplifi  er is made up of two stages or many more, the split-half signal tracing or signal injection tech-
nique is an effi  cient troubleshooting method.Figure 9-26   Troubleshooting multistage ampliﬁ  ers.

Summary
SEC. 9-1   MULTISTAGE 
AMPLIFIERS
The overall voltage gain equals the 
product of the individual voltage 
gains. The input impedance of the 
second stage is the load resistance 
on the ﬁ  rst stage. Two CE stages pro-
duce an ampliﬁ  ed in-phase signal.
SEC. 9-2   TWO-STAGE 
FEEDBACK
We can feed back the output 
voltage of the second collector to 
the ﬁ  rst emitter through a voltage 
divider. This produces negative 
feedback, which stabilizes the volt-
age gain of the two-stage ampliﬁ  er.
SEC. 9-3  CC AMPLIFIER
A CC ampliﬁ  er, better known as an 
emitter follower, has its collector at 
ac ground. The input signal drives 
the base, and the output signal 
comes from the emitter. Because it is 
heavily swamped, an emitter follower 
has stable voltage gain, high input 
impedance, and low distortion.
SEC. 9-4   OUTPUT IMPEDANCE
The output impedance of an am-
pliﬁ  er is the same as its Thevenin impedance. An emitter follower has 
a low output impedance. The current 
gain of a transistor transforms the 
source impedance driving the base 
to a much lower value when seen 
from the emitter.
SEC. 9-5   CASCADING CE 
AND CC
When a low resistance load is con-
nected to the output of a CE am-
pliﬁ  er, it may become overloaded, 
resulting in a very small voltage 
gain. A CC ampliﬁ  er placed between 
the CE output and load will signiﬁ  -
cantly reduce this eff  ect. In this way, 
the CC ampliﬁ  er is acting as a buff  er.
SEC. 9-6   DARLINGTON 
CONNECTIONS
Two transistors can be connected 
as a Darlington pair. The emitter of 
the ﬁ  rst is connected to the base of 
the second. This produces an overall 
current gain equal to the product of 
the individual current gains.
SEC. 9-7   VOLTAGE 
REGULATION
By combining a zener diode and 
an emitter follower, we get a zener follower. This circuit produces regu-
lated output voltage with large load 
currents. The advantage is that the 
zener current is much smaller than 
the load current. By adding a stage 
of voltage gain, a larger regulated 
output voltage can be produced.
SEC. 9-8   COMMON-BASE 
AMPLIFIER
The CB ampliﬁ  er conﬁ  guration has 
its base at ac ground. The input 
signal drives the emitter, and the 
output signal comes from the collec-
tor. Even though this circuit has no 
current gain, it can produce a signif-
icant voltage gain. The CB ampliﬁ  er 
has a low input  impedance and high 
output impedance, and is used in 
high-frequency applications.

In most electronic systems applications, the input signal is 
small. After several stages of voltage gain, however, the signal 
becomes large and uses the entire load line. In these later 
stages of a system, the collector currents are much larger 
because the load impedances are much smaller. Stereo ampliﬁ  er 
speakers, for example, may have an impedance of 8 V or less.
Small-signal transistors have a power rating of less than 1 W, 
whereas power transistors have a power rating of more than 
1 W. Small-signal transistors are typically used at the front end 
of systems where the signal power is low, and power transistors 
are used near the end of systems because the signal power and 
current are high.

There are different ways to describe amplifi  ers. For instance, we can describe 
them by their class of operation, by their interstage coupling, or by their frequency 
range.
Classes of Operation
Class-A operation  of an amplifi  er means that the transistor operates in the active 
region at all times. This implies that collector current fl  ows for 360° of the ac 
cycle, as shown in Fig. 10-1 a. With a Class-A amplifi  er, the designer usually tries 
to locate the Q point somewhere near the middle of the load line. This way, the 
signal can swing over the maximum possible range without saturating or cutting 
off the transistor, which would distort the signal.
 Class-B operation  is different. It means that collector current fl  ows for 
only half the cycle (180°), as shown in Fig. 10-1 b. To have this kind of operation, 
a designer locates the Q point at cutoff. Then, only the positive half-cycle of ac 
base voltage can produce collector current. This reduces the wasted heat in power 
 transistors.
 Class-C operation  means that collector current fl  ows for less than 180° 
of the ac cycle, as shown in Fig. 10-1 c. With Class-C operation, only part of the 
positive half-cycle of ac base voltage produces collector current. As a result, we 
get brief pulses of collector current like those of Fig. 10-1 c.
Types of Coupling
Figure 10-2 a shows capacitive coupling.  The coupling capacitor transmits the 
amplifi  ed ac voltage to the next stage. Figure 10-2 b illustrates transformer 
 coupling.  Here, the ac voltage is coupled through a transformer to the next stage. 
Capacitive coupling and transformer coupling are both examples of ac coupling, 
which blocks the dc voltage.
 Direct coupling  is different. In Fig. 10-2 c, there is a direct connection 
between the collector of the fi  rst transistor and the base of the second transistor.

As we progress through the 
letters A, B, and C designating 
the various classes of operation, 
we can see that linear operation 
occurs for shorter and shorter 
intervals of time. A Class-D 
amplifier is one whose output 
is switched on and off; that is, 
it essentially spends zero time 
during each input cycle in the 
linear region of operation. A 
Class-D amplifier is often used 
as a pulse-width modulator, 
which is a circuit whose output 
pulses have widths that are pro-
portional to the amplitude level 
of the amplifier’s input signal.

Because of this, both the dc and the ac voltages are coupled. Since there is no lower 
frequency limit, a direct-coupled amplifi  er is sometimes called a dc amplifi  er.
Ranges of Frequency
Another way to describe amplifi  ers is by stating their frequency range. For 
 instance, an audio amplifi  er refers to an amplifi  er that operates in the range of 
20 Hz to 20 kHz. On the other hand, a radio-frequency (RF) amplifi  er is one 
that amplifi  es frequencies above 20 kHz, usually much higher. For instance, the 
RF amplifi  ers in AM radios amplify frequencies between 535 and 1605 kHz, and 
the RF amplifi  ers in FM radios amplify frequencies between 88 and 108 MHz.
 Amplifi  ers are also classifi  ed as narrowband  or wideband.  A narrow-
band amplifi  er works over a small frequency range like 450 to 460 kHz. A wide- 
band amplifi  er operates over a large frequency range like 0 to 1 MHz.
 Narrowband amplifi  ers are usually tuned RF amplifi  ers, which means 
that their ac load is a high- Q resonant tank tuned to a radio station or television 
channel. Wideband amplifi  ers are usually untuned; that is, their ac load is resistive.
 Figure 10-3 a is an example of a tuned RF amplifi  er. The LC tank is res-
onant at some frequency. If the tank has a high Q, the bandwidth is narrow. The 
output is capacitively coupled to the next stage.
 Figure 10-3 b is another example of a tuned RF amplifi  er. This time, the 
narrowband output signal is transformer-coupled to the next stage.
Signal Levels
We have already described small-signal operation,  in which the peak-to-peak 
swing in collector current is less than 10 percent of quiescent collector current. In 
large-signal  operation,  a peak-to-peak signal uses all or most of the load line. In 
a stereo system, the small signal from a radio tuner or compact disc player is used 
as the input to a preamp,  a low-noise amplifi  er that is designed with the proper 370 Chapter   10input impedance to pick up the signal from the input source, provide some level 
of amplifi  cation, and deliver the output to the next stage. Following the preamp, 
one or more stages of amplifi  cation are used to produce a larger output suitable for 
driving tone and volume controls. The signal is then used as the input to a power 
amplifi  er, which produces output power ranging from a few hundred milliwatts 
up to hundreds of watts.
 In the remainder of this chapter, we will discuss power amplifi  ers and 
 related topics like the ac load line, power gain, and effi  ciency.
10-2  Two Load Lines
Every amplifi  er has a dc-equivalent circuit and an ac-equivalent circuit. Because 
of this, it has two load lines: a dc load line and an ac load line. For small-signal 
operation, the location of the Q point is not critical. But with large-signal ampli-
fi ers, the Q point has to be at the middle of the ac load line to get the maximum 
possible output swing.
DC Load Line
Figure 10-4 a is a voltage-divider-based (VDB) amplifi  er. One way to move the Q 
point is by varying the value of R2. For very large values of R2, the transistor goes 
into saturation and its current is given by:
IC(sat) 5   VCC ________ RC 1 RE   (10-1)
Very small values of R2 will drive the transistor into cutoff, and its voltage is 
given by:
VCE(cutoff)  5 VCC (10-2)
Figure 10-4 b shows the dc load line with the Q point.
AC Load Line
Figure 10-4 c is the ac-equivalent circuit for the VDB amplifi  er. With the emitter 
at ac ground, RE has no effect on the ac operation. Furthermore, the ac collec-
tor resistance is less than the dc collector resistance. Therefore, when an ac sig-
nal comes in, the instantaneous operating point moves along the ac load line  of R1CL

(b)Figure 10-3   Tuned RF ampliﬁ  ers: ( a) capacitive coupling; ( b) transformer coupling.Power Ampliﬁ  ers 371Fig. 10-4 d. In other words, the peak-to-peak sinusoidal current and voltage are 
 determined by the ac load line.
 As shown in Fig. 10-4 d, the saturation and cutoff points on the ac load 
line differ from those on the dc load line. Because the ac collector and emitter 
 resistance are lower than the respective dc resistance, the ac load line is much 
steeper. It’s important to note that the ac and dc load lines intersect at the Q point. 
This happens when the ac input voltage is crossing zero.
 Here’s how to determine the ends of the ac load line. Writing a collector 
voltage loop gives us:
vce 1 icrc 5 0
or
ic 5 2   vce ___ rc   (10-3)
 The ac collector current is given by:
ic 5 DIC 5 IC 2 ICQ
 and the ac collector voltage is:
vce 5 DVCE 5 VCE 2 VCEQ
 When substituting these expressions into Eq. (10-3) and rearranging, we 
arrive at:

When the transistor goes into cutoff, IC equals zero. Since 
vce(cutoff)  5 VCEQ 1 DVCE
and
DVCE 5 (DIC)(rc)
we can substitute to get:
DVCE 5 (ICQ 2 0A)(rc)
resulting in:
vce(cutoff)  5 VCEQ 1 ICQrc (10-6)
 Because the ac load line has a higher slope than the dc load line, the 
 maximum peak-to-peak (MPP) output is always less than the supply voltage. As a 
formula:
MPP  , VCC (10-7)
For instance, if the supply voltage is 10 V , the maximum peak-to-peak sinusoidal 
output is less than 10 V .
Clipping of Large Signals
When the Q point is at the center of the dc load line (Fig. 10-4 d), the ac signal 
cannot use all of the ac load line without clipping. For instance, if the ac signal 
increases, we will get the cutoff clipping shown in Fig. 10-5 a.
 If the Q point is moved higher, as shown in Fig. 10-5 b, a large signal 
will drive the transistor into saturation. In this case, we get saturation clipping. 
Both cutoff and saturation clipping are undesirable because they distort the signal. 
When a distorted signal like this drives a loudspeaker, it sounds terrible.
 A well-designed large-signal amplifi  er has the Q point at the middle of the 
ac load line (Fig. 10-5 c). In this case, we get a maximum peak-to-peak  unclipped 
output. This maximum unclipped peak-to-peak ac voltage is also  referred to its 
ac output compliance.
Maximum Output
When the Q point is below the center of the ac load line, the maximum peak (MP) 
output is ICQrc, as shown in Fig. 10-6 a. On the other hand, if the Q point is above 
the center of the ac load line, the maximum peak output is VCEQ, as shown in 
Fig. 10-6 b.
 For any Q point, therefore, the maximum peak output is:
MP 5 ICQrc  or  VCEQ,  whichever is smaller  (10-8)
and the maximum peak-to-peak output is twice this amount:
MPP  5 2MP (10-9)
Equations (10-8) and (10-9) are useful in troubleshooting to determine the largest 
unclipped output that is possible.Power Ampliﬁ  ers 373 When the Q point is at the center of the ac load line:
ICQrc 5 VCEQ (10-10)
A designer will try to satisfy this condition as closely as possible, given the tol-
erance of biasing resistors. The circuit’s emitter resistance can be adjusted to fi  nd 
the optimum Q point. A formula that can be derived for the optimum emitter 
 resistance is :

The VDB amplifi  er in Fig. 10-8 a is a Class-A amplifi  er as long as the output sig-
nal is not clipped. With this kind of amplifi  er, collector current fl  ows throughout 
the cycle. Stated another way, no clipping of the output signal occurs at any time 
during the cycle. Now, we discuss a few equations that are useful in the analysis 
of Class-A amplifi  ers.
Power Gain
Besides voltage gain, any amplifi  er has a power gain,  defi  ned as:
Ap 5   pout ____ pin   (10-12)
In words, the power gain equals the ac output power divided by the ac input power.

GOOD TO KNOW
The power gain AP of a common-
emitter amplifier equals AV 3 Ai. 
Since Ai can be expressed as 
Ai 5 AV 3 Zin/RL, then AP can be 
expressed as AP 5 AV 3 AV 3 
Zin/RL or AP 5 A2V 3 Zin/RL.376 Chapter   10 For instance, if the amplifi  er in Fig. 10-8 a has an output power of 10 mW 
and an input power of 10 /H9262W, it has a power gain of:
Ap 5   10 mW _______ 10 /H9262W   5 1000
Output Power
If we measure the output voltage in Fig. 10-8 a in rms volts, the output power is 
given by:
pout 5   vrms2 _____ RL   (10-13)
 Usually, we measure the output voltage in peak-to-peak volts with an 
oscilloscope. In this case, a more convenient equation to use for output power is:
pout 5   vout2 ____ 8RL   (10-14)
The factor of 8 in the denominator occurs because vp-p 5 2 √—
 2   vrms. When you 
square 2 √—
 2   , you get 8.
 The maximum output power occurs when the amplifi  er is producing 
the maximum peak-to-peak output voltage, as shown in Fig. 10-8 b. In this case, 
vp-p equals the maximum peak-to-peak output voltage and the maximum output 
power is:
pout(max)  5   MPP2 ______ 8RL   (10-15)
Transistor Power Dissipation
When no signal drives the amplifi  er in Fig. 10-8 a, the quiescent power dissipation 
is:
PDQ 5 VCEQICQ (10-16)
This makes sense. It says that the quiescent power dissipation equals the dc volt-
age times the dc current.
 When a signal is present, the power dissipation of a transistor decreases 
because the transistor converts some of the quiescent power to signal power. For 
this reason, the quiescent power dissipation is the worst case. Therefore, the power 
rating of a transistor in a Class-A amplifi  er must be greater than PDQ; otherwise, 
the transistor will be destroyed.
Current Drain
As shown in Fig. 10-8 a, the dc voltage source has to supply a dc current Idc to 
the amplifi  er. This dc current has two components: the biasing current through 
the voltage divider and the collector current through the transistor. The dc cur-
rent is called the current drain  of the stage. If you have a multistage amplifi  er, 
you have to add the individual current drains to get the total current drain.
Effi  ciency
The dc power supplied to an amplifi  er by the dc source is:
Pdc 5 VCCIdc (10-17)
To compare the design of power amplifi  ers, we can use the effi ciency,  defi  ned by:
h 5   pout ____ Pdc   3 100% (10-18)Power Ampliﬁ  ers 377
This equation says that the effi  ciency equals the ac output power divided by the 
dc input power.
 The effi  ciency of any amplifi  er is between 0 and 100 percent. Effi  ciency 
gives us a way to compare two different designs because it indicates how well 
an amplifi  er converts the dc input power to ac output power. The higher the ef-
fi ciency, the better the amplifi  er is at converting dc power to ac power. This is 
 important in battery-operated equipment because high effi  ciency means that the 
batteries last longer.
 Since all resistors except the load resistor waste power, the effi  ciency 
is less than 100 percent in a Class-A amplifi  er. In fact, it can be shown that the 
maximum effi  ciency of a Class-A amplifi  er with a dc collector resistance and a 
separate load resistance is 25 percent.
 In some applications, the low effi  ciency of Class-A is acceptable. For 
instance, the small-signal stages near the front of a system usually work fi  ne with 
low effi  ciency because the dc input power is small. In fact, if the fi  nal stage of a 
system needs to deliver only a few hundred milliwatts, the current drain on the 
power supply may still be low enough to accept. But when the fi  nal stage needs to 
deliver watts of power, the current drain usually becomes too large with Class-A 
operation.

system, a designer will usually locate the Q point at the center of the ac load line 
to get maximum peak-to-peak (MPP) output.
Application Example  10-5
Describe the action of Fig. 10-10.
SOLUTION   This is a Class-A power amplifi  er driving a loudspeaker. The 
 amplifi  er uses voltage-divider bias, and the ac input signal is transformer- coupled 
to the base. The transistor produces voltage and power gain to drive the loud-
speaker through the output transformer.
A small speaker with an impedance of 3.2 V needs only 100 mW in 
order to operate. A slightly larger speaker with an impedance of 8 V needs 300 
to 500 mW for proper operation. Therefore, a Class-A power amplifi  er like 
Fig. 10-10 may be adequate if all you need is a few hundred milliwatts of output 
power. Since the load resistance is also the ac collector resistance, the effi  ciency 
of this Class-A amplifi  er is higher than that of the Class-A amplifi  er discussed 
 earlier. Using the impedance-refl  ecting ability of the transformer, the speaker load
resistance appears   (   NP ___ NS   )  2
  times larger at the collector. If the transformer’s turns
ratio were 10:1, a 3.2- V speaker would appear as 320 V at the collector.
The Class-A amplifi  er discussed earlier had a separate collector re-
sistance RC and a separate load resistance RL. The best you can do in this case 
is to match the impedances, RL 5 RC, to get a maximum effi  ciency of 25 per-
cent. When the load resistance becomes the ac collector resistor, as shown in 
Fig. 10-10, it receives twice as much output power, and the maximum effi  ciency 
increases to 50 percent.

 When the Q point is below the center of the ac load line, the maximum

plifi er is essentially the same as for a CE amplifi  er. The difference is the need to 
use the emitter ac resistance re instead of the collector ac resistance rc. To increase 
the output power level, the emitter follower may also be connected in a Darlington

Class-A is the common way to run a transistor in linear circuits because it leads to 
the simplest and most stable biasing circuits. But Class-A is not the most effi  cient 
way to operate a transistor. In some applications, like battery-powered systems, 
current drain and stage effi  ciency become important considerations in the design. 
This section introduces the basic idea of Class-B operation.
Push-Pull Circuit
Figure 10-14 shows a basic Class-B amplifi  er. When a transistor operates as 
Class-B, it clips off half a cycle. To avoid the resulting distortion, we can use two 
 transistors in a push-pull arrangement like that of Fig. 10-14. Push-pull  means 
that one transistor conducts for half a cycle while the other is off, and vice versa.

age, the secondary winding of T1 has voltage v1 and v2, as shown. Therefore, the 
upper transistor conducts and the lower one cuts off. The collector current through 
Q1 fl ows through the upper half of the output primary winding. This produces an 
 amplifi  ed and inverted voltage, which is transformer-coupled to the loudspeaker.
 On the next half-cycle of input voltage, the polarities reverse. Now, the 
lower transistor turns on and the upper transistor turns off. The lower transistor 
amplifi  es the signal, and the alternate half-cycle appears across the loudspeaker.
 Since each transistor amplifi  es one-half of the input cycle, the loud-
speaker receives a complete cycle of the amplifi  ed signal.
Advantages and Disadvantages
Since there is no bias in Fig. 10-14, each transistor is at cutoff when there is no 
input signal, an advantage because there is no current drain when the signal is zero.
 Another advantage is improved effi  ciency where there is an input signal. 
The maximum effi  ciency of a Class-B push-pull amplifi  er is 78.5 percent, so a 
Class-B push-pull power amplifi  er is more commonly used for an output stage 
than a Class-A power amplifi  er.
 The main disadvantage of the amplifi  er shown in Fig. 10-14 is the use of 
transformers. Audio transformers are bulky and expensive. Although widely used 
at one time, a transformer-coupled amplifi  er like Fig. 10-14 is no longer popular. 
Newer designs have eliminated the need for transformers in most applications. 
10-5  Class-B Push-Pull Emitter 
Follower
Class-B operation  means that the collector current fl  ows for only 180° of the ac 
cycle. For this to occur, the Q point is located at cutoff on both the dc and the ac 
load lines. The advantage of Class-B amplifi  ers is lower current drain and higher 
stage effi  ciency.
Push-Pull Circuit
Figure 10-15 a shows one way to connect a Class-B push-pull emitter follower. 
Here, we have an npn emitter follower and a pnp emitter follower connected in a 
push-pull arrangement.
Let’s begin the analysis with the dc-equivalent circuit of Fig. 10-15 b. 
The designer selects biasing resistors to set the Q point at cutoff. This biases the 
 emitter diode of each transistor between 0.6 and 0.7 V, so that it is on the verge 
of conduction. Ideally:

value of voltage. As a result, half the supply voltage is dropped across each tran-
sistor’s collector-emitter terminals. That is:
VCEQ 5   VCC ____ 2   (10-23)
DC Load Line
Since there is no dc resistance in the collector or emitter circuits of Fig. 10-15 b, 
the dc saturation current is infi  nite. This means that the dc load line is vertical, 
as shown in Fig. 10-16 a. If you think that this is a dangerous situation, you are 
right. The most diffi  cult thing about designing a Class-B amplifi  er is setting up a 
stable Q point at cutoff. The barrier potential of a silicon pn junction decreases by 
2 mV for each degree Celsius rise. When a Class-B amplifi  er is producing an output 
signal, its temperature increases. Any signifi  cant decrease in VBE with temperature 
can move the Q point up the dc load line to dangerously high currents. For the 
 moment, assume that the Q point is rock-solid at cutoff, as shown in Fig. 10-16 a.

half-cycle, the other transistor does the same thing. This means that the maximum 
peak-to-peak output is:
MPP  5 VCC (10-24)
AC Analysis
Figure 10-16 b shows the ac equivalent of the conducting transistor. This is almost 
identical to the Class-A emitter follower. Ignoring re9, the voltage gain is:
Av < 1 (10-25)
and the input impedance of the base is:
zin(base)  < bRL (10-26)
Overall Action
On the positive half-cycle of input voltage, the upper transistor of Fig. 10-15 a con-
ducts and the lower one cuts off. The upper transistor acts like an ordinary emitter 
follower, so that the output voltage approximately equals the input voltage.
On the negative half-cycle of input voltage, the upper transistor cuts off 
and the lower transistor conducts. The lower transistor acts like an ordinary emit-
ter follower and produces a load voltage approximately equal to the input volt-
age. The upper transistor handles the positive half-cycle of input voltage, and the 
lower transistor takes care of the negative half-cycle. During either half-cycle, the 
source sees a high input impedance looking into either base.
Crossover Distortion

ter  follower. Suppose that no bias is applied to the emitter diodes. Then, the

Q POINT
(c)Figure 10-17  (a) AC-equivalent circuit; ( b) crossover distortion; ( c) Q point is 
slightly above cutoff  .386 Chapter   10incoming ac voltage has to rise to about 0.7 V to overcome the barrier potential 
of the emitter diodes. Because of this, no current fl  ows through Q1 when the 
signal is less than 0.7 V .
The action is similar on the other half-cycle. No current fl  ows through Q2 
until the ac input voltage is more negative than 20.7 V. For this reason, if no bias 
is applied to the emitter diodes, the output of a Class-B push-pull emitter follower 
looks like Fig. 10-17 b.
Because of clipping between half-cycles, the output is distorted. Since 
the clipping occurs between the time one transistor cuts off and the other one 
comes on, we call it crossover distortion.  To eliminate crossover distortion, we 
need to apply a slight forward bias to each emitter diode. This means locating the 
Q point slightly above cutoff, as shown in Fig. 10-17 c. As a guide, an ICQ from 1 
to 5 percent of IC(sat) is enough to eliminate crossover distortion.
Class-AB
In Fig. 10-17 c, the slight forward bias implies that the conduction angle will be 
slightly greater than 180° because the transistor will conduct for a bit more than 
half a cycle. Strictly speaking, we no longer have Class-B operation. Because of 
this, the operation is sometimes referred to as Class-AB,  defi  ned as a conduction 
angle between 180° and 360°. But it is barely Class-AB. For this reason, many 
people still refer to the circuit as a Class-B push-pull amplifi  er  because the oper-
ation is Class-B to a close approximation.
Power Formulas
The formulas shown in Summary Table 10-1 apply to all classes of operation, 
including Class-B push-pull operation.
 When using these formulas to analyze a Class-B/AB push-pull emitter 
follower, remember that the Class-B/AB push-pull amplifi  er has the ac load line 
and waveforms of Fig. 10-18 a. Each transistor supplies half of a cycle.
Transistor Power Dissipation
Ideally, the transistor power dissipation is zero when there is no input signal 
 because both transistors are cut off. If there is a slight forward bias to prevent 
crossover distortion, the quiescent power dissipation in each transistor is still very 
small.

Some power amplifiers are bi-
ased to operate as Class-AB am-
plifiers to improve the linearity 
of the output signal. A Class-AB 
amplifier has a conduction angle 
of roughly 210°. The improved 
linearity of the output signal 
does not come without a price, 
however—a reduction in the cir-
cuit’s efficiency.Power Ampliﬁ  ers 387When an input signal is present, the transistor power dissipation becomes

when the peak-to-peak output is 63 percent of MPP. Since this is the worst case,

As mentioned earlier, the hardest thing about designing a Class-B/AB amplifi  er 
is setting up a stable Q point near cutoff. This section discusses the problem and 
its solution.
Voltage-Divider Bias
Figure 10-20 shows voltage-divider bias for a Class-B/AB push-pull circuit. The 
two transistors have to be complementary; that is, they must have similar VBE
curves, maximum ratings, and so forth. For instance, the 2N3904 Q1 and 2N3906 
Q2 transistors are complementary, the fi  rst being an npn transistor and the second 
being a pnp. They have similar VBE curves, maximum ratings, and so on. Comple-
mentary pairs like these are available for almost any Class-B/AB push-pull design.
To avoid crossover distortion in Fig. 10-20, we set the Q point slightly 
above cutoff, with the correct VBE somewhere between 0.6 and 0.7 V. But here 
is the major problem: The collector current is very sensitive to changes in VBE. 
Data sheets indicate that an increase of 60 mV in VBE produces 10 times as much 
 collector current. Because of this, an adjustable resistor is needed to set the correct 
Q point.
But an adjustable resistor does not solve the temperature problem. Even 
though the Q point may be perfect at room temperature, it will change when the 
temperature changes. As discussed earlier, VBE decreases approximately 2 mV per 
degree rise. As the temperature increases in Fig. 10-20, the fi  xed voltage on each 
emitter diode forces the collector current to increase rapidly. If the temperature 
 increases 30°, the collector current increases by a factor of 10 because the fi  xed 
bias is 60 mV too high. Therefore, the Q point is very unstable with voltage- 
divider bias.
The ultimate danger in Fig. 10-20 is thermal runaway.  When the 
temperature increases, the collector current increases. As the collector current 
increases, the junction temperature increases even more, further reducing the 
correct VBE. This escalating situation means that the collector current may “run 
away” by rising until excessive power destroys the transistor.
Whether or not thermal runaway takes place depends on the thermal 
properties of the transistor, how it is cooled, and the type of heat sink used. More 
often than not, voltage-divider bias like Fig. 10-20 will produce thermal runaway, 
which destroys the transistors.
Diode Bias
One way to avoid thermal runaway is with diode bias, shown in Fig. 10-21. The 
idea is to use compensating diodes  to produce the bias voltage for the emitter 
diodes. For this scheme to work, the diode curves must match the VBE curves 
of the transistors. Then, any increase in temperature reduces the bias voltage 
developed by the compensating diodes by just the right amount.
For instance, assume that a bias voltage of 0.65 V sets up 2 mA of 
 collector current. If the temperature rises 30°C, the voltage across each compen-
sating diode drops 60 mV. Since the required VBE also decreases by 60 mV, the 
 collector current remains fi  xed at 2 mA.
For diode bias to be immune to changes in temperature, the diode curves 
must match the VBE curves over a wide temperature range. This is not easily done 
with discrete circuits because of the tolerance of components. But diode bias is 
easy to implement with integrated circuits because the diodes and transistors are 
on the same chip, which means that they have almost identical curves.R1

GOOD TO KNOW
In actual designs, the compen-
sating diodes are mounted on 
the case of the power transistors 
so that as the transistors heat 
up, so do the diodes. The di-
odes are usually mounted to the 
power transistors with a noncon-
ductive adhesive that has good 
thermal transfer characteristics.390 Chapter   10With diode bias, the bias current through the compensating diodes of 
Fig. 10-21 is:
Ibias 5   VCC 2 2VBE ___________  2R   (10-28)
When the compensating diodes match the VBE curves of the transistors, ICQ has the 
same value as Ibias. As mentioned earlier, ICQ should be between 1 and 5 percent of 
IC(sat) to avoid crossover distortion. R

In the earlier discussion of the Class-B/AB push-pull emitter follower, the ac sig-
nal was capacitively coupled into the bases. This is not the preferred way to drive 
a Class-B/AB push-pull amplifi  er.
CE Driver
The stage that precedes the output stage is called a driver.  Rather than capaci-
tively couple into the output push-pull stage, we can use the direct-coupled CE 
driver shown in Fig. 10-23 a. Transistor Q1 is a current source that sets up the dc 
biasing current through the diodes. By adjusting R2, we can control the dc emitter 
current through R4. This means that Q1 sources the biasing current through the 
compensating diodes.
When an ac signal drives the base of Q1, it acts like a swamped amplifi  er. 
The amplifi  ed and inverted ac signal at the Q1 collector drives the bases of Q2 and 
Q3. On the positive half-cycle, Q2 conducts and Q3 cuts off. On the negative half -
cycle, Q2 cuts off and Q3 conducts. Because the output coupling capacitor is an ac 
short, the ac signal is coupled to the load resistance.
Figure 10-23 b shows the ac-equivalent circuit of the CE driver. Because 
the diodes are biased on by the dc current, the diodes are replaced by their ac 
emitter resistances. In any practical circuit, re9 is at least 100 times smaller than 
R3. Therefore, the ac-equivalent circuit simplifi  es to Fig. 10-23 c.
Now, we can see that the driver stage is a swamped amplifi  er whose 
amplifi  ed and inverted output drives both bases of the output transistors with the 
same signal. Often, the input impedance of the output transistors is very high, and 
we can approximate the voltage gain of the driver by:
AV 5   R3 ___ R4  
In short, the driver stage is a swamped voltage amplifi  er that produces a large 
 signal for the output push-pull amplifi  er.
The dc input power is:
Pdc 5 (20 V)(0.32 A) 5 6.4 W
The maximum ac output power is:
pout(max)  5   MPP2 _____ 8RL   5   (20 V)2 _______ 8(10 V)   5 5 W

/H9257 5   pout ___ Pdc   3 100%  5   5 W ______ 6.4 W   3 100%  5 78.1%
PRACTICE PROBLEM 10-10   Repeat Example 10-10 using 130 V 
for VCC.392 Chapter   10Two-Stage Negative Feedback
Figure 10-24 is another example of using a large-signal CE stage to drive a 
Class-B/AB push-pull emitter follower. The input signal is amplifi  ed and in-
verted by the Q1 driver. The push-pull stage then provides the current gain 
needed to drive the low-impedance loudspeaker. Notice that the CE driver has 
its emitter connected to ground. As a result, this driver has more voltage gain 
than the driver of Fig. 10-23 a.
The resistance R2 does two useful things: First, since it is connected 
to a dc voltage of 1VCC/2, this resistance provides the dc bias for Q1. Second, 
R2 produces negative feedback for the ac signal. Here’s why: A positive-going 
signal on the base of Q1 produces a negative-going signal on the Q1 collector. 
The output of the emitter follower is therefore negative-going. When fed back 
through R2 to the Q1 base, this returning signal opposes the original input signal. 
This is negative feedback, which stabilizes the bias and the voltage gain of the 
overall amplifi  er.
 Integrated circuit (IC) audio power amplifi  ers are often used in low- to 
medium-power applications. These amplifi  ers, such as an LM380 IC, contain 
Class-AB biased output transistors and will be discussed in Chapter 16.+VCC

With Class-B, we need to use a push-pull arrangement. That’s why almost all 
Class-B amplifi  ers are push-pull amplifi  ers. With Class-C, we need to use a resonant 
circuit for the load. This is why almost all Class-C amplifi  ers are tuned amplifi  ers.
Resonant Frequency
With Class-C operation, the collector current fl  ows for less than half a cycle. A 
parallel resonant circuit can fi  lter the pulses of collector current and produce a pure 
sine wave of output voltage. The main application for Class-C is with tuned RF 
amplifi  ers. The maximum effi  ciency of a tuned Class-C amplifi  er is 100 percent.
 Figure 10-25 a shows a tuned RF amplifi  er. The ac input voltage drives 
the base, and an amplifi  ed output voltage appears at the collector. The amplifi  ed 
and inverted signal is then capacitively coupled to the load resistance. Because 
of the parallel resonant circuit, the output voltage is maximum at the resonant 
frequency, given by:
fr 5   1 _______ 2p √— LC      (10-29)
 On either side of the resonant frequency fr, the voltage gain drops off 
as shown in Fig. 10-25 b. For this reason, a tuned Class-C amplifi  er is always 
intended to amplify a narrow band of frequencies. This makes it ideal for ampli-
fying radio and television signals because each station or channel is assigned a 
narrow band of frequencies on both sides of a center frequency.
 The Class-C amplifi  er is unbiased, as shown in the dc-equivalent circuit 
of Fig. 10-25 c. The resistance RS in the collector circuit is the series resistance of 
the inductor.
Load Lines
Figure 10-25 d shows the two load lines. The dc load line is approximately vertical 
because the winding resistance RS of an RF inductor is very small. The dc load vin+VCC

GOOD TO KNOW
Most Class-C amplifiers are de-
signed so that the peak value 
of input voltage is just suffi-
cient to drive the transistor into 
saturation.394 Chapter   10line is not important because the transistor is unbiased. What is important is the ac 
load line. As indicated, the Q point is at the lower end of the ac load line. When an 
ac signal is present, the instantaneous operating point moves up the ac load line 
toward the saturation point. The maximum pulse of collector current is given by 
the saturation current VCC/rc.
DC Clamping of Input Signal
Figure 10-25 e is the ac-equivalent circuit. The input signal drives the emitter 
diode, and the amplifi  ed current pulses drive the resonant tank circuit. In a tuned 
Class-C amplifi  er, the input capacitor is part of a negative dc clamper. For this 
reason, the signal appearing across the emitter diode is negatively clamped.
 Figure 10-26 a illustrates the negative clamping. Only the positive peaks 
of the input signal can turn on the emitter diode. For this reason, the collector 
current fl  ows in brief pulses like those of Fig. 10-26 b.
Filtering the Harmonics
A nonsinusoidal waveform like Fig. 10-26 b is rich in harmonics,  multiples of 
the input frequency. In other words, the pulses of Fig. 10-26 b are equivalent to a 
group of sine waves with frequencies of f, 2f, 3f, . . . , nf.
 The resonant tank circuit of Fig. 10-26 c has a high impedance only at 
the fundamental frequency f. This produces a large voltage gain at the fundamen-
tal frequency. On the other hand, the tank circuit has a very low impedance to 
the higher harmonics, producing very little voltage gain. This is why the voltage DC LOAD LINEC L

all higher harmonics are fi  ltered, only the fundamental frequency appears across 
the tank circuit.
Troubleshooting
Since the tuned Class-C amplifi  er has a negatively clamped input signal, you can 
use a high-impedance dc voltmeter or DMM to measure the voltage across the 
emitter diode. If the circuit is working correctly, you should read a negative volt-
age  approximately equal to the peak of the input signal.
 The voltmeter test just described is useful when an oscilloscope is not 
handy. If you have an oscilloscope, however, an even better test is to look across 
the emitter diode. You should see a negatively clamped waveform when the circuit 
is working properly. To prevent circuit loading, remember to use the 10x setting 
on the oscilloscope probe.EMITTER

Application Example  10-11
Describe the action of Fig. 10-27.
SOLUTION   The circuit has a resonant frequency of:
fr 5   1 ________________   2/H9266 √ ——  (2 /H9262H)(470 pF)   5 5.19 MHz
If the input signal has this frequency, the tuned Class-C circuit will amplify the 
input signal.
In Fig. 10-27, the input signal has a peak-to-peak value of 10 V. The signal 
is negatively clamped at the base of the transistor with a positive peak of 10.7 V 396 Chapter   1010-9  Class-C Formulas
A tuned Class-C amplifi  er is usually a narrowband amplifi  er. The input signal in a 
Class-C circuit is amplifi  ed to get large output power with an effi  ciency approach-
ing 100 percent.
Bandwidth
As discussed in basic courses, the bandwidth (BW)  of a resonant circuit is 
 defi ned as:
BW 5 f2 2 f1 (10-30)
where f1 5 lower half-power frequency
f2 5 upper half-power frequency
The half-power frequencies are identical to the frequencies at which the voltage 
gain equals 0.707 times the maximum gain, as shown in Fig. 10-28. The smaller 
BW is, the narrower the bandwidth of the amplifi  er.
and a negative peak of 29.3 V. The average base voltage is 24.3 V, which can be 
measured with a high-impedance dc voltmeter.
The collector signal is inverted because of the CE connection. The dc or 
average voltage of the collector waveform is 115 V, the supply voltage. There-
fore, the peak-to-peak collector voltage is 30 V. This voltage is capacitively cou-
pled to the load resistance. The fi  nal output voltage has a positive peak of 115 V 
and a negative peak of 215 V.

BW 5   fr __ Q   (10-31)
where Q is the quality factor of the circuit. Equation (10-31) says that the band-
width is inversely proportional to Q. The higher the Q of the circuit, the smaller 
the bandwidth.
 Class-C amplifi  ers almost always have a circuit Q that is greater than 10. 
This means that the bandwidth is less than 10 percent of the resonant frequency. 
For this reason, Class-C amplifi  ers are narrowband amplifi  ers. The output of a 
narrowband amplifi  er is a large sinusoidal voltage at resonance with a rapid drop-
off above and below resonance.
Current Dip at Resonance
When a tank circuit is resonant, the ac load impedance seen by the collector cur-
rent source is maximum and purely resistive. Therefore, the collector current 
is minimum at resonance. Above and below resonance, the ac load impedance 
 decreases and the collector current increases.
 One way to tune a resonant tank is to look for a decrease in the dc current 
supplied to the circuit, as shown in Fig. 10-29. The basic idea is to measure the 
current Idc from the power supply while tuning the circuit (varying either L or C). 
When the tank is resonant at the input frequency, the ammeter reading will dip to a 
minimum value. This indicates that the circuit is correctly tuned because the tank 
has a maximum impedance at this point.
AC Collector Resistance
Any inductor has a series resistance RS, as indicated in Fig. 10-30 a. The Q of the 
inductor is defi  ned as:

RS 5 coil resistance
Remember that this is the Q of the coil only. The overall circuit has a lower Q 
 because it includes the effect of load resistance as well as coil resistance.
 As discussed in basic ac courses, the series resistance of the inductor can 
be replaced by a parallel resistance RP, as shown in Fig. 10-30 b. When Q is greater 
than 10, this equivalent resistance is given by:
RP 5 QLXL (10-33)
In Fig. 10-30 b, XL cancels XC at resonance, leaving only RP in parallel with RL. 
Therefore, the ac resistance seen by the collector at resonance is:
rc 5 RP i RL (10-34)
 The Q of the overall circuit  is given by:
Q 5   rc ___ XL   (10-35)
This circuit Q is lower than QL, the coil Q. In practical Class-C amplifi  ers, the Q 
of the coil is typically 50 or more, and the Q of the circuit is 10 or more. Since the 
overall Q is 10 or more, the operation is narrowband.
Duty Cycle
The brief turn-on of the emitter diode at each positive peak produces narrow 
pulses of collector current, as shown in Fig. 10-31 a. With pulses like these, it is 
convenient to defi  ne the duty cycle  as:
D 5   W __ T  T   (10-36)
where D 5 duty cycle
W 5 width of pulse
T 5 period of pulses
For instance, if an oscilloscope displays a pulse width of 0.2 /H9262s and a period of 
1.6 /H9262s, the duty cycle is:
D 5   0.2___ 1.6     /H9262s ___ /H9262s   5 0.125
 The smaller the duty cycle, the narrower the pulses compared to the pe-
riod. The typical Class-C amplifi  er has a small duty cycle. In fact, the effi  ciency 
of a Class-C amplifi  er increases as the duty cycle decreases.
Conduction Angle
An equivalent way to state the duty cycle is by using the conduction angle /H9278, 
shown in Fig. 10-31 b:

Transistor Power Dissipation
Figure 10-32 a shows the ideal collector-emitter voltage in a Class-C transistor 
amplifi  er. In Fig. 10-32 a, the maximum output is given by:
MPP  5 2VCC (10-38)
Since the maximum voltage is approximately 2 VCC, the transistor must have a 
VCEO rating greater than 2 VCC.
 Figure 10-32 b shows the collector current for a Class-C amplifi  er. Typi-
cally, the conduction angle /H9278 is much less than 180°. Notice that the collector cur-
rent reaches a maximum value of IC(sat). The transistor must have a peak current 
rating greater than this. The dotted parts of the cycle represent the off time of the 
transistor.
 The power dissipation of the transistor depends on the conduction angle. 
As shown in Fig. 10-32 c, the power dissipation increases with the conduction 
angle up to 180°. The maximum power dissipation of the transistor can be derived 
using calculus:
PD 5   MPP2 ______ 40rc   (10-39)
 Equation (10-39) represents the worst case. A transistor operating as 
Class-C must have a power rating greater than this or it will be destroyed. Under 
normal drive conditions, the conduction angle will be much less than 180° and the 
transistor power dissipation will be less than MPP2/40rc.
Stage Effi   ciency

smaller conduction angles, the dc collector current is less than this, as shown in 
Fig. 10-32 d. The dc collector current is the only current drain in a Class-C ampli-
fi  er because it has no biasing resistors.
 In a Class-C amplifi  er, most of the dc input power is converted into ac 
load power because the transistor and coil losses are small. For this reason, a 
Class-C amplifi  er has high stage effi  ciency.
 Figure 10-32 e shows how the optimum stage effi  ciency varies with con-
duction angle. When the angle is 180°, the stage effi  ciency is 78.5 percent, the the-
oretical maximum for a Class-B amplifi  er. When the conduction angle decreases, 
the stage effi  ciency increases. As indicated, Class-C has a maximum effi  ciency of 
100 percent, approached at very small conduction angles.

 amplifi  ers.
10-10  Transistor Power Rating
The temperature at the collector junction places a limit on the allowable power 
dissipation PD. Depending on the transistor type, a junction temperature in the 
range of 150 to 200°C will destroy the transistor. Data sheets specify this max-
imum junction temperature as TJ(max). For instance, the data sheet of a 2N3904 
gives a TJ(max) of 150°C; the data sheet of a 2N3719 specifi  es a TJ(max) of 200°C.
Ambient Temperature
The heat produced at the junction passes through the transistor case (metal or 
plastic housing) and radiates to the surrounding air. The temperature of this air, 
known as the ambient temperature,  is around 25°C, but it can get much higher 
on hot days. Also, the ambient temperature may be much higher inside a piece of 
electronic equipment.
Derating Factor
Data sheets often specify the PD(max) of a transistor at an ambient temperature of 
25°C. For instance, the 2N1936 has a PD(max) of 4 W for an ambient temperature 
of 25°C. This means that a 2N1936 used in a Class-A amplifi  er can have a quies-
cent power dissipation as high as 4 W. As long as the ambient temperature is 25°C 
or less, the transistor is within its specifi  ed power rating.
 What do you do if the ambient temperature is greater than 25°C? You 
have to derate (reduce) the power rating. Data sheets sometimes include a derat-
ing curve  like the one in Fig. 10-34. As you can see, the power rating decreases 
when the ambient temperature increases. For instance, at an ambient temperature 
of 100°C, the power rating is 2 W.
 Some data sheets do not give a derating curve like the one in Fig. 10-34. 
Instead, they list a derating factor D. For instance, the derating factor of a 2N1936 6

ambient temperature.GOOD TO KNOW
With integrated circuits, a max-
imum junction temperature 
cannot be specified because 
there are so many transistors. 
Therefore, ICs have a maximum 
device temperature or case 
temperature instead. For exam-
ple, the /H9262A741 op-amp IC has a 
power rating of 500 mW if it is 
in a metal package, 310 mW if it 
is in a dual-inline package, and 
570 mW if it is in a flatpack.

CPower Ampliﬁ  ers 403is 26.7 mW/°C. This means that you have to subtract 26.7 mW for each degree the 
ambient temperature is above 25°C. In symbols:
DP 5 D(TA 2 25°C) (10-40)
where DP 5 decrease in power rating 
D 5 derating factor
TA 5 ambient temperature
As an example, if the ambient temperature rises to 75°C, you have to reduce the 
power rating by:
DP 5 26.7 mW(75  2 25) 5 1.34 W
Since the power rating is 4 W at 25°C, the new power rating is:
PD(max) 5 4 W 2 1.34 W  5 2.66 W
This agrees with the derating curve of Fig. 10-34.
 Whether you get the reduced power rating from a derating curve like 
the one in Fig. 10-34 or from a formula like the one in Eq. (10-40), the important 
thing to be aware of is the reduction in power rating as the ambient temperature 
increases. Just because a circuit works well at 25°C doesn’t mean it will perform 
well over a large temperature range. When you design circuits, therefore, you 
must take the operating temperature range into account by derating all transistors 
for the highest expected ambient temperature.
Heat Sinks
One way to increase the power rating of a transistor is to get rid of the heat faster. 
This is why heat sinks are used. If we increase the surface area of the transistor 
case, we allow the heat to escape more easily into the surrounding air. Look at 
Fig. 10-35 a. When this type of heat sink is pushed on to the transistor case, heat 
radiates more quickly because of the increased surface area of the fi  ns.
 Figure 10-35 b shows the power-tab transistor. The metal tab provides a 
path out of the transistor for heat. This metal tab can be fastened to the chassis of 
electronics equipment. Because the chassis is a massive heat sink, heat can easily 
escape from the transistor to the chassis.
 Large power transistors like Fig. 10-35 c have the collector connected 
directly to the case to let heat escape as easily as possible. The transistor case is 
then fastened to the chassis. The PIN diagram in Fig. 10-35 c shows the transistor’s 
connections as viewed from the bottom of the transistor. To prevent the collector

transistor with collector connected to case.404 Chapter   10from shorting to the chassis ground, a thin insulating washer and a thermal con-
ductive paste are used between the transistor case and the chassis. The important 
idea here is that heat can leave the transistor more rapidly, which means that the 
transistor has a higher power rating at the same ambient temperature.
Case Temperature
When heat fl  ows out of a transistor, it passes through the case of the transistor 
and into the heat sink, which then radiates the heat into the surrounding air. The 
 temperature of the transistor case TC will be slightly higher than the temperature of 
the heat sink TS, which in turn is slightly higher than the ambient tempera ture TA.
 The data sheets of large power transistors give derating curves for the 
case temperature rather than the ambient temperature. For instance, Fig. 10-36 
shows the derating curve of a 2N3055. The power rating is 115 W at a case tem-
perature of 25°C; then it decreases linearly with temperature until it reaches zero 
for a case temperature of 200°C.
 Sometimes you get a derating factor instead of a derating curve. In this 
case, you can use the following equation to calculate the reduction in power  rating:
DP 5 D(TC 2 25°C)  (10-41)
where DP 5 decrease in power rating
D 5 derating factor
TC 5 case temperature
To use the derating curve of a large power transistor, you need to know what the 
case temperature will be in the worst case. Then you can derate the transistor to 
arrive at its maximum power rating.Figure 10-36  2N3055 derating curve. Used with permission from SCILLC dba

The circuit of Fig. 10-37 is required to operate over an ambient temperature range 
of 0 to 50°C. What is the maximum power rating of the transistor for the worst-
case temperature?
SOLUTION   The worst-case temperature is the highest one because you have 
to derate the power rating given on a data sheet. If you look at the data sheet of a 
2N3904, you will see the maximum power rating is listed as:
PD 5 625 mW at 25°C ambientPower Ampliﬁ  ers 405
and the derating factor is given as:
D 5 5 mW/°C
Using Eq. (10-40), we can calculate:
DP 5 (5 mW)(50 2 25) 5 125 mW
Therefore, the maximum power rating at 50°C is:
PD(max) 5 625 mW 2 125 mW 5 500 mW

SEC. 10-1  AMPLIFIER TERMS
The classes of operation are A, B, 
and C. The types of coupling are 
capacitive, transformer, and direct. 
Frequency terms include audio, 
RF, narrowband, and wideband. 
Some types of audio ampliﬁ  ers are 
preamps and power ampliﬁ  ers.
SEC. 10-2  TWO LOAD LINES
Every ampliﬁ  er has a dc load line and 
an ac load line. To get maximum peak-
to-peak output, the Q point should be 
in the center of the ac load line.
SEC. 10-3   CLASS-A 
OPERATION
The power gain equals the ac output 
power divided by the ac input power. 
The power rating of a transistor must 
be greater than the quiescent power 
dissipation. The effi   ciency of an ampliﬁ  er stage equals the ac output 
power divided by the dc input power, 
times 100 percent. The maximum 
effi  ciency of Class-A with a collector 
and load resistor is 25 percent. If the 
load resistor is the collector resistor 
or uses a transformer, the maximum 
effi  ciency increases to 50 percent.
SEC. 10-4  CLASS-B OPERATION
Most Class-B ampliﬁ  ers use a push-
pull connection of two transistors. 
While one transistor conducts, the 
other is cut off  , and vice versa. Each 
transistor ampliﬁ  es one-half of the 
ac cycle. The maximum effi   ciency of 
Class-B is 78.5 percent.
SEC. 10-5   CLASS-B PUSH-PULL 
EMITTER FOLLOWER
Class-B is more effi   cient than Class-A. 
In a Class-B push-pull emitter follower, complementary npn and pnp tran-
sistors are used. The npn transistor 
 conducts on one half-cycle, and the 
pnp transistor on the other.
SEC. 10-6   BIASING CLASS-B/
AB AMPLIFIERS
To avoid crossover distortion, the 
transistors of a Class-B push-pull 
emitter follower have a small quies-
cent current. This is referred to as a 
Class-AB. With voltage divider bias, 
the Q point is unstable and may re-
sult in thermal runaway. Diode bias is 
preferred because it can produce a 
stable Q point over a large tempera-
ture range.
SEC. 10-7  CLASS-B/AB DRIVER
Rather than capacitive-couple the 
signal into the output stage, we can 
use a direct-coupled driver stage. Summary406 Chapter   10The collector current out of the 
driver sets up the quiescent current 
through the complementary diodes.
SEC. 10-8   CLASS-C 
OPERATION
Most Class-C ampliﬁ  ers are tuned 
RF ampliﬁ  ers. The input signal is 
negatively clamped, which produces 
narrow pulses of collector current. The tank circuit is tuned to the fun-
damental frequency so that all higher 
harmonics are ﬁ  ltered out.
SEC. 10-9  CLASS-C FORMULAS
The bandwidth of a Class-C ampliﬁ  er 
is inversely proportional to the Q of 
the circuit. The ac collector resist-
ance includes the parallel-equivalent 
resistance of the inductor and the 
load resistance.SEC. 10-10   TRANSISTOR 
POWER RATING
The power rating of a transistor 
decreases as the temperature 
increases. The data sheet of a tran-
sistor either lists a derating factor or 
shows a graph of the power rating 
versus temperature. Heat sinks can 
remove the heat more rapidly, pro-
ducing a higher power rating.

JFETs
The bipolar junction transistor (BJT) relies on two types of 
charge: free electrons and holes. This is why it is called bipolar:  
the preﬁ  x bi stands for “two.” This chapter discusses another 
kind of transistor called the ﬁ eld-eff  ect transistor (FET).  This 
type of device is unipolar  because its operation depends on 
only one type of charge, either free electrons or holes. In other 
words, an FET has majority carriers but not minority carriers.
For most linear applications, the BJT is the preferred device. 
But there are some linear applications in which the FET is better 
suited because of its high input impedance and other properties. 
Furthermore, the FET is the preferred device for most switching 
applications. Why? Because there are no minority carriers in an 
FET. As a result, it can switch off   faster since no stored charge 
has to be removed from the junction area.
There are two kinds of unipolar transistors: JFETs and MOSFETs. 
This chapter discusses the junction ﬁ  eld-eff  ect transistor (JFET)  
and its applications. In Chapter 12, we discuss the metal-oxide 
semiconductor FET (MOSFET)  and its applications.

Figure 11-1 a shows a piece of n-type semiconductor. The lower end is called the 
source,  and the upper end is called the drain.  The supply voltage VDD forces free 
electrons to fl  ow from the source to the drain. To produce a JFET, a manufac-
turer diffuses two areas of p-type semiconductor into the n-type semiconductor, 
as shown in Fig. 11-1 b. These p regions are connected internally to get a single 
 external gate lead.
Field Eff  ect
Figure 11-2 shows the normal biasing voltages for a JFET. The drain supply volt-
age is positive, and the gate supply voltage is negative. The term fi eld effect  is 
 related to the depletion layers around each p region. These depletion layers exist 
because free electrons diffuse from the n regions into the p regions. The recom-
bination of free  electrons and holes creates the depletion layers shown by the 
 colored a reas.
Reverse Bias of Gate
In Fig. 11-2, the p-type gate and the n-type source form the gate-source diode. 
With a JFET, we always reverse-bias  the gate-source diode. Because of reverse 
bias, the gate current IG is approximately zero, which is equivalent to saying that 
the JFET has an almost infi  nite input resistance.GOOD TO KNOW
In general, JFETs are more 
 temperature stable than bipolar 
transistors. Furthermore, JFETs 
are typically much smaller than 
bipolar transistors. This size dif-
ference makes them particularly 
suitable for use in ICs, where 
the size of each component is 
critical.

VGG–+–+Figure 11-2   Normal biasing of JFET.JFETs 417A typical JFET has an input resistance in the hundreds of megohms. This 
is the big advantage that a JFET has over a bipolar transistor. It is the reason that 
JFETs excel in applications in which a high input impedance is required. One of 
the most important applications of the JFET is the source follower,  a circuit like 
the emitter follower, except that the input impedance is in the hundreds of meg-
ohms for lower frequencies.
Gate Voltage Controls Drain Current
In Fig. 11-2, electrons fl  owing from the source to the drain must pass through the 
narrow channel  between the depletion layers. When the gate voltage becomes 
more negative, the depletion layers expand and the conducting channel becomes 
narrower. The more negative the gate voltage, the smaller the current between the 
source and the drain.
The JFET is a voltage-controlled device  because an input voltage con-
trols an output current. In a JFET, the gate-to-source voltage VGS determines how 
much current fl  ows between the source and the drain. When VGS is zero, maxi-
mum drain current fl  ows through the JFET. This is why a JFET is referred to as 
a normally on device. On the other hand, if VGS is negative enough, the depletion 
layers touch and the drain current is cut off.
Schematic Symbol
The JFET of Fig. 11-2 is an n-channel JFET  because the channel between the 
source and the drain is an n-type semiconductor. Figure 11-3 a shows the sche-
matic symbol for an n-channel JFET. In many low-frequency applications, the 
source and the drain are interchangeable because you can use either end as the 
source and the other end as the drain.
The source and drain terminals are not interchangeable at high frequen-
cies. Almost always, the manufacturer minimizes the internal capacitance on the 
drain side of the JFET. In other words, the capacitance between the gate and the 
drain is smaller than the capacitance between the gate and the source. You will 
learn more about internal capacitances and their effect on circuit action in a later 
chapter.
Figure 11-3 b shows an alternative symbol for an n-channel JFET. This 
symbol with its offset gate is preferred by many engineers and technicians. The 
offset gate points to the source end of the device, a defi  nite advantage in compli-
cated multistage circuits.
There is also a p-channel JFET. The schematic symbol for a p-channel 
JFET, shown in Fig. 11-3 c, is similar to that for the n-channel JFET, except that 
the gate arrow points in the opposite direction. The action of a p-channel JFET 
is complementary; that is, all voltages and currents are reversed. To reverse-bias 
a p-channel JFET, the gate is made positive in respect to the source. Therefore, 
VGS is made positive.

The depletion layers are actu-
ally wider near the top of the 
p-type materials and narrower 
at the bottom. The reason for 
the change in the width can be 
understood by realizing that the 
drain current ID will produce a 
voltage drop along the length 
of the channel. With respect 
to the source, a more positive 
voltage is present as you move 
up the channel toward the drain 
end. Since the width of a deple-
tion layer is proportional to the 
amount of reverse-bias voltage, 
the depletion layer of the pn 
junction must be wider at the 
top, where the amount of 
reverse-bias voltage is greater.418 Chapter 1111-2 Drain Curves
Figure 11-4 a shows a JFET with normal biasing voltages. In this circuit, the 
gate-source voltage VGS equals the gate supply voltage VGG, and the drain-source 
 voltage VDS equals the drain supply voltage VDD.
Maximum Drain Current
If we short the gate to the source, as shown in Fig. 11-4 b, we will get maximum 
drain current because VGS 5 0. Figure 11-4 c shows the graph of drain current ID 
versus drain-source voltage VDS for this shorted-gate condition. Notice how the 
drain current increases rapidly and then becomes almost horizontal when VDS is 
greater than VP.
Example 11-1
A 2N5486 JFET has a gate current of 1 nA when the reverse gate voltage is 20 V .

The pinchoff voltage VP is the 
point at which further increases 
in VDS are offset by a propor-
tional increase in the channel’s 
resistance. This means that if the 
channel resistance is increasing 
in direct proportion to VDS above 
VP, ID must remain the same 
above  VP.JFETs 419Why does the drain current become almost constant? When VDS in-
creases, the depletion layers expand. When VDS 5 VP, the depletion layers are 
 almost touching. The narrow conducting channel therefore pinches off or prevents 
a  further increase in current. This is why the current has an upper limit of IDSS.
The active region of a JFET is between VP and VDS(max). The minimum 
voltage VP is called the pinchoff voltage,  and the maximum voltage VDS(max) is 
the breakdown voltage.  Between pinchoff and breakdown, the JFET acts like a 
current source of approximately IDSS when VGS 5 0.
IDSS stands for the current drain to source with a shorted gate. This is 
the maximum drain current a JFET can produce. The data sheet of any JFET 
lists the value of IDSS. This is one of the most important JFET quantities, and 
you should always look for it fi  rst because it is the upper limit on the JFET 
 current.
The Ohmic Region
In Fig. 11-5, the pinchoff voltage separates two major operating regions of the 
JFET. The almost-horizontal region is the active region. The almost-vertical part 
of the drain curve below pinchoff is called the ohmic region.
When operated in the ohmic region, a JFET is equivalent to a resistor 
with a value of approximately:
RDS 5   VP ____ IDSS   (11-1)
RDS is called the ohmic resistance of the JFET.  In Fig. 11-5, VP 5 4 V and 
IDSS 5 10 mA. Therefore, the ohmic resistance is:
RDS 5   4 V ______ 10 mA   5 400 V
If the JFET is operating anywhere in the ohmic region, it has an ohmic resistance 
of 400 V.
Gate Cutoff   Voltage
Figure 11-5 shows the drain curves for a JFET with an IDSS of 10 mA. The top 
curve is always for VGS 5 0, the shorted-gate condition. In this example, the 
 pinchoff voltage is 4 V and the breakdown voltage is 30 V . The next curve down 
is for VGS 5 2 1 V , the next for VGS 5 2 2 V , and so on. As you can see, the more 
negative the gate-source voltage, the smaller the drain current.

drain current to almost zero. This voltage is called the gate-source cutoff voltage
and is symbolized by VGS(off) on data sheets. At this cutoff voltage, the depletion 
layers touch. In effect, the conducting channel disappears. This is why the drain 
current is approximately zero.
In Fig. 11-5, notice that
VGS(off) 5 2 4 V    and    VP 5 4 V
This is not a coincidence. The two voltages always have the same magnitude 
 because they are the values where the depletion layers touch or almost touch. Data 
sheets may list either quantity, and you are expected to know that the other has the 
same magnitude. As an equation:
VGS(off) 5 2 VP (11-2)
Example 11-2

SOLUTION   The ohmic resistance is:
RDS 5   6 V _______ 100 mA   5 60 V
Since the pinchoff voltage is 6 V , the gate-source cutoff voltage is:
VGS(off) 5 2 6 V
PRACTICE PROBLEM 11-2   A 2N5484 has a VGS(off) 5 23.0 V and 
IDSS 5 5 mA. Find its ohmic resistance and Vp values.
11-3 The Transconductance Curve
The transconductance curve  of a JFET is a graph of ID versus VGS. By reading 
the values of ID and VGS of each drain curve in Fig. 11-5, we can plot the curve of 
Fig. 11-6 a. Notice that the curve is nonlinear because the current increases faster 
when VGS approaches zero.
 Any JFET has a transconductance curve like Fig. 11-6 b. The end points 
on the curve are VGS(off) and IDSS. The equation for this graph is:
ID 5 IDSS   ( 1 2   VGS _________ VGS(off)   )  2
  (11-3)
Because of the squared quantity in this equation, JFETs are often called square-law 
devices.  The squaring of the quantity produces the nonlinear curve of Fig. 11-6 b.
 Figure 11-6 c shows a normalized transconductance curve. Normalized 
means that we are graphing ratios like ID/IDSS and VGS/VGS(off). GOOD TO KNOW
The transconductance curve of a 
JFET is unaffected by the circuit 
or configuration in which the 
JFET is used.GOOD TO KNOW
There is often a lot of confusion 
in textbooks and in manufac-
turers’ data sheets regarding 
the terms cutoff  and pinchoff . 
VGS(off) is the value of VGS that 
completely pinches off the chan-
nel, thus reducing the drain cur-
rent to zero. On the other hand, 
the pinchoff voltage is the value 
of VDS at which ID levels off with 
VGS 5 0 V.JFETs 421In Fig. 11-6 c, the half-cutoff point

16Figure 11-6   Transconductance curve.422 Chapter 1111-4 Biasing in the Ohmic Region
The JFET can be biased in the ohmic or in the active region. When biased in the 
ohmic region, the JFET is equivalent to a resistance. When biased in the active 
 region, the JFET is equivalent to a current source. In this section, we discuss 
gate bias, the method used to bias a JFET in the ohmic region.
Gate Bias
Figure 11-7 a shows gate bias.  A negative gate voltage of 2VGG is applied to the 
gate through biasing resistor RG. This sets up a drain current that is less than IDSS. 
When the drain current fl  ows through RD, it sets up a drain voltage of:
VD 5 VDD 2 IDRD (11-4)
Gate bias is the worst way to bias a JFET in the active region because the Q point 
is too unstable.
 For example, a 2N5459 has the following spreads between minimum 
and maximum: IDSS varies from 4 to 16 mA, and VGS(off) varies from 22 to 28 V. 
 Figure 11-7 b shows the minimum and maximum transconductance curves. If a 
gate bias of 21 V is used with this JFET, we get the minimum and maximum 
Q points shown. Q1 has a drain current of 12.3 mA, and Q2 has a drain current of 
only 1 mA.
Hard Saturation
Although not suitable for active-region biasing, gate bias is perfect for ohmic- 
region biasing because stability of the Q point does not matter. Figure 11-7 c 
shows how to bias a JFET in the ohmic region. The upper end of the dc load line 
has a drain saturation current of:
ID(sat) 5   VDD ____ RD  
To ensure that a JFET is biased in the ohmic region, all we need to do is use 
VGS 5 0 and:
ID(sat) , , IDSS (11-5)
Example 11-4
A 2N5459 has VGS(off) 5 2 8 V and IDSS 5 16 mA. What is the drain current at the 
half-cutoff point?
SOLUTION   The drain current is one quarter of the maximum, or:
ID 5 4 mA
The gate-source voltage that produces this current is 24 V , half of the cutoff 
 voltage.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 11-4   Repeat Example 11-4 using a JFET with 
VGS(off) 5 26 V and IDSS 5 12 mA.JFETs 423The symbol  ,, means “much less than.” This equation says that the drain satura-
tion current must be much less than the maximum drain current. For instance, if a 
JFET has IDSS 5 10 mA, hard saturation will occur if VGS 5 0 and ID(sat) 5 1 mA.
 When a JFET is biased in the ohmic region, we can replace it by a resis-
tance of RDS, as shown in Fig. 11-7 d. With this equivalent circuit, we can calculate 
the drain voltage. When RDS is much smaller than RD, the drain voltage is close 
to zero.RD+VDD

SOLUTION   Since VP 5 4 V , VGS(off) 5 2 4 V . Before point A in time, the input voltage is 210 V and the JFET is cut 
off. In this case, the drain voltage is:

ID(sat) 5   10 V ______ 10 kV   5 1 mA
Figure 11-8 b shows the dc load line. Since ID(sat) is much less than IDSS, the JFET is in hard saturation.

JFET amplifi  ers need to have a Q point in the active region. Because of the large 
spread in JFET parameters, we cannot use gate bias. Instead, we need to use 
other biasing methods. Some of these methods are similar to those used with 
bipolar junction transistors.
 The choice of analysis technique depends on the level of accuracy 
needed. For example, when doing preliminary analysis and troubleshooting of 
 biasing circuits, it is often desirable to use ideal values and circuit approximations. 
In JFET circuits, this means that we will often ignore VGS values. Usually, the 
ideal answers will have an error of less that 10 percent. When closer analysis is 
called for, we can use graphical solutions to determine a circuit’s Q point. If you 
are designing JFET circuits or need even greater accuracy, you should use a  circuit 
simulator like Multisim.
Self-Bias
Figure 11-9 a shows self-bias.  Since drain current fl  ows through the source  resistor 
RS, a voltage exists between the source and ground, given by:
VS 5 IDRS (11-6)
Since VG is zero:
VGS5 2 IDRS (11-7)
This says that the gate-source voltage equals the negative of the voltage across 
the source resistor. Basically, the circuit creates its own bias by using the voltage 
 developed a cross RS to reverse-bias the gate.
Figure 11-9 b shows the effect of different source resistors. There is a 
medium value of RS at which the gate-source voltage is half of the cutoff voltage. 
An approximation for this medium resistance is:
RS < RDS (11-8)
This equation says that the source resistance should equal the ohmic resistance of 
the JFET. When this condition is satisfi  ed, the VGS is roughly half the cutoff volt-
age and the drain current is roughly one-quarter of IDSS.

(a) (b)Figure 11-9   Self-bias.426 Chapter 11When a JFET’s transconductance curves are known, we can analyze a 
self-bias circuit using graphical methods. Suppose a self-bias JFET has the trans-
conductance curve shown in Fig. 11-10. The maximum drain current is 4 mA, and 
the gate voltage has to be between 0 and 22 V. By graphing Eq. (11-7), we can 
fi nd out where it intersects the transconductance curve and determine the values 
of VGS and ID. Since Eq. (11-7) is a linear equation, all we have to do is plot two 
points and draw a line through them.
Suppose the source resistance is 500 V. Then Eq. (11-7) becomes:
VGS 5 2ID (500 V)
Since any two points can be used, we choose the two convenient points corre-
sponding to ID 5 2(0)(500 V) 5 0; therefore, the coordinates for the fi  rst point 
are (0, 0), which is the origin. To get the second point, fi  nd VGS for ID 5 IDSS. In 
this case, ID 5 4 mA and VGS 5 2(4 mA)(500 V) 5 22 V; therefore, the coordi-
nates of the second point are at (4 mA, 22 V).
We now have two points on the graph of Eq. (11-7). The two points are 
(0, 0) and (4 mA, 22 V). By plotting these two points as shown in Fig. 11-10, we 
can draw a straight line through the two points as shown. This line will, of course, 
intersect the transconductance curve. This intersection point is the operating point 
of the self-biased JFET. As you can see, the drain current is slightly less than 
2 mA, and the gate-source voltage is slightly less than 21 V. 
 In summary, here is a process for fi  nding the Q point of any self-biased 
JFET, provided you have the transconductance curve. If the curve is not avail-
able, you can use the VGS(off) and IDSS rated values, along with the square law 
equation (11-3), to develop one:
1. Multiply IDSS by RS to get VGS for the second point.
2. Plot the second point ( IDSS, VGS).
3. Draw a line through the origin and the second point.
4. Read the coordinates of the intersection point.
The Q point with self-bias is not extremely stable. Because of this, self-
bias is used only with small-signal amplifi  ers. This is why you may see self- biased 
JFET circuits near the front end of communication receivers where the signal 
is small.VGSQID

Using the Multisim circuit of Fig. 11-12 a, along with the minimum and maximum transconductance curves for a 2N5486 
JFET shown in Fig. 11-12 b, determine the range of VGS and ID Q point values. Also, what would be the optimum source 
 resistor for this JFET?
SOLUTION   First, multiply IDSS by RS to get VGS:
VGS 5 2(20 mA)(270 V) 5 25.4 V
Second, plot the second point ( IDSS, VGS):
(20 mA, 25.4 V)
Now draw a line through the origin (0, 0) and the second point. Then read the coordinates of the intersection points for the 
minimum and maximum Q point values.
Q point (min) VGS 5 20.8 V  ID 5 2.8 mA
Q point (max) VGS 5 22.1 V ID 5 8.0 mA
Note that the Multisim measured values of Fig. 11-12 a are between the minimum and maximum values. The  optimum 
source resistor can be found by:
RS 5   VGS(off) _________ IDSS     or  RS 5   VP ____ IDSS  
using minimum values:
RS 5   2 V _____ 8 mA   5 250 V

Voltage-Divider Bias
Figure 11-13 a shows voltage-divider bias.  The voltage divider produces a gate 
voltage that is a fraction of the supply voltage. By subtracting the gate-source 
voltage, we get the voltage across the source resistor:
VS 5 VG 2 VGS (11-9)JFETs 429Since VGS is a negative, the source voltage will be slightly larger than the gate 
voltage. When you divide this source voltage by the source resistance, you get the 
drain current:
ID 5   VG 2 VGS _________  RS       VG ___ RS   (11-10)
 When the gate voltage is large, it can swamp out the variations in VGS
from one JFET to the next. Ideally, the drain current equals the gate voltage 
 divided by the source resistance. As a result, the drain current is almost constant 
for any JFET, as shown in Fig. 11-13 b.
 Figure 11-13 c shows the dc load line. For an amplifi  er, the Q point has 
to be in the active region. This means that VDS must be greater than IDRDS (ohmic 
 region) and less than VDD (cutoff). When a large supply voltage is available, 
voltage-divider bias can set up a stable Q point.
 When more accuracy is needed in determining the Q point for a voltage-
divider bias circuit, a graphical method can be used. This is especially true when 
the minimum and maximum VGS values for a JFET vary several volts from each 
other. In Fig. 11-13 a, the voltage applied to the gate is:
VG 5   R2 _______ R1 1 R2   (VDD) (11-11)
 Using transconductance curves, as in Fig. 11-14, plot the VG value on the 
horizontal, or x-axis, of the graph. This becomes one point on our bias line. To get 
the second point, use Eq. (11-10) with VGS 5 0 V to determine ID. This second point, 
where ID 5 VG/RS, is plotted on the vertical, or y-axis, of the transconductance curve. 
Next, draw a line between these two points and extend the line so it intersects the 
transconductance curves. Finally, read the coordinates of the intersection points.ID

VG 5   1 MV _____________   2 MV 1 1 M V   (30 V) 5 10 V
 This value is plotted on the x-axis.
 Next, fi  nd the second point:
ID 5   VG ___ RS   5   10 V — 2 kV   5 5 mA
 This value is plotted on the y-axis.
 By drawing a line between these two points that extends through the minimum and maximum transconductance 
curves, we fi  nd:
VGS(min) 5 20.4 V    ID(min) 5 5.2 mA
and
VGS(max) 5 22.4 V    ID(max) 5 6.3 mA
 Fig. 11-16 b shows that the measured Multisim values fall between the calculated minimum and maximum 
 values.

Two-Supply Source Bias
Figure 11-17 shows two-supply source bias. The drain current is given by:
ID 5   VSS 2 VGS _________  RS   ø   VSS ____ RS   (11-12)
Again, the idea is to swamp out the variations in VGS by making VSS much larger 
than VGS. Ideally, the drain current equals the source supply voltage divided by the 
source resistance. In this case, the drain current is almost constant in spite of JFET 
replacement and temperature change.
Current-Source Bias
When the drain supply voltage is not large, there may not be enough gate voltage 
to swamp out the variations in VGS. In this case, a designer may prefer to use the 
current-source bias  of Fig. 11-18 a. In this circuit, the bipolar junction transistor 
pumps a fi  xed current through the JFET. The drain current is given by:
ID 5   VEE 2 VBE __________  RE   (11-13)
 Figure 11-18 b illustrates how effective current-source bias is. Both Q
points have the same current. Although VGS is different for each Q point, VGS no 
longer has an effect on the value of drain current.RS+VDD

To analyze JFET amplifi  ers, we need to discuss transconductance,  designated 
gm and defi  ned as:
gm5id___vgs (11-14)
This says that transconductance equals the ac drain current divided by the ac gate-
source voltage. Transconductance tells us  how effective the gate-source voltage 
is in controlling the drain current.  The higher the transconductance, the more 
control the gate voltage has over the drain current.
 For instance, if id 5 0.2 mA p-p when vgs 5 0.1 V p-p, then:
gm 5   0.2 mA _______ 0.1 V   5 2(1023) mho  5 2000 /H9262mho
On the other hand, if id 5 1 mA p-p when vgs 5 0.1 V p-p, then:
gm 5   1 mA_____
0.1 V 5 10,000 /H9262mho
In the second case, the higher transconductance means that the gate is more 
 effective in controlling the drain current.
Siemen
The unit mho is the ratio of current to voltage. An equivalent and modern 
unit for the mho is the siemen (S),  so the foregoing answers can be written as 
2000  /H9262S and 10,000 /H9262S. On data sheets, either quantity (mho or siemen) may 
be used. Data sheets may also use the symbol gfs instead of gm. As an example, 
the data sheet of a 2N5451 lists a gfs of 2000 /H9262S for a drain current of 1 mA. 
This is identical to saying that the 2N5451 has a gm of 2000 /H9262mho for a drain 
current of 1 mA.
Slope of Transconductance Curve
Figure 11-20 a brings out the meaning of gm in terms of the transconductance 
curve. Between points A and B, a change in VGS produces a change in ID. The 
change in ID divided by the change in VGS is the value of gm between A and B. If

Many years ago, vacuum tubes 
were used instead of transistors. 
A vacuum tube is also a 
voltage-controlled device where 
an input grid-cathode voltage 
VGK controls an output plate 
current IP.JFETs 437we select another pair of points farther up the curve at C and D, we get a bigger 
change in ID for the same change in VGS. Therefore, gm has a larger value higher up 
the curve. Stated another way, gm is the slope of the transconductance curve. The 
steeper the curve is at the Q point, the higher the transconductance.
 Figure 11-20 b shows an ac-equivalent circuit for a JFET. A very high 
 resistance RGS is between the gate and the source. The drain of a JFET acts like 
a current source with a value of gmvgs. Given the values of gm and vgs, we can 
 calculate the ac drain current.
Transconductance and Gate-Source 
Cutoff   Voltage
The quantity VGS(off) is diffi  cult to measure accurately. On the other hand, IDSS
and gm0 are easy to measure with high accuracy. For this reason, VGS(off) is often 
 calculated with the following equation:
VGS(off) 5   22IDSS _______  gm0   (11-15)
In this equation, gm0 is the value of transconductance when VGS 5 0. Typically, a 
manufacturer will use the foregoing equation to calculate the value of VGS(off) for 
use on data sheets.
 The quantity gm0 is the maximum value of gm for a JFET because it 
 occurs when VGS 5 0. When VGS becomes negative, gm decreases. Here is the 
equation for calculating gm for any value of VGS:
gm 5 gm0  ( 1 2   VGS ______ VGS(off)   )  (11-16)
Notice that gm decreases linearly when VGS becomes more negative, as shown in 
Fig. 11-20 c. Changing the value of gm is useful in automatic gain control,  which 
is discussed later.GOOD TO KNOW
For every JFET, there is a value 
of VGS near VGS(off) that results in 
a zero temperature coefficient. 
This means that, for some value 
of VGS near VGS(off), ID does not 
either increase or decrease with 
increases in temperature.
Example 11-12
A 2N5457 has IDSS 5 5 mA and gm0 5 5000 /H9262S. What is the value of VGS(off)? 
What does gm equal when VGS 5 2 1 V?
SOLUTION  Using Eq. (11-15):
VGS(off) 5    22(5 mA) _________  5000 /H9262S   5 2 2 V
Next, use Eq. (11-16) to get:
gm 5 (5000 /H9262S)  ( 1 2   1 V ____ 2 V   )  5 2500 /H9262S
PRACTICE PROBLEM 11-12   Repeat Example 11-12 using IDSS 5 8 mA 
and VGS 5 –2 V .438 Chapter 1111-7 JFET Ampliﬁ  ers
Figure 11-21 a shows a common-source (CS) amplifi  er. The coupling and bypass 
capacitors are ac shorts. Because of this, the signal is coupled directly into the 
gate. Since the source is bypassed to ground, all of the ac input voltage appears 
between the gate and the source. This produces an ac drain current. Since the ac 
drain current fl  ows through the drain resistor, we get an amplifi  ed and inverted ac 
output voltage. This output signal is then coupled to the load resistor.
Voltage Gain of CS Ampliﬁ  er
Figure 11-21 b shows the ac-equivalent circuit. The ac drain resistance rd is defi  ned as:
rd 5 RDiRL
The voltage gain is:
Av 5vout___vin 5   gmvinrd ______vin
which simplifi  es to:
Av 5 gmrd (11-17)
This says that the voltage gain of a CS amplifi  er equals the transconductance 
times the ac drain resistance.
Input and Output Impedance of CS Ampliﬁ  er
Since a JFET normally has a reverse biased gate-source junction, its input resis-
tance at the gate RGS is very large. RGS can be approximated by using values taken 
from the JFET’s data sheet and can be found by:

Because of the extremely high 
input impedance of a JFET, the 
input current is generally as-
sumed to be 0 /H9262A, and the cur-
rent gain of a JFET amplifier is 
an undefined quantity.
GOOD TO KNOW
For any JFET small-signal ampli-
fier, the input signal that drives 
the gate should never reach a 
point at which the gate-source 
junction is forward biased.JFETs 439As an example, if IGSS is 22.0 nA when VGS is 215 V , RGS would equal 7500 M V.
 As shown in Fig. 11-21 b, the input impedance of the stage is:
zin(stage)  = R1iR2iRGS
Because RGS is normally very large, as compared to the input biasing resistors, the 
input impedance of the stage can be reduced to: 
zin(stage)  = R1iR2 (11-19)
 In a CS amplifi  er, zout(stage)  looks back into the circuit from the load re-
sistor RL.  In Fig. 11-21 b, the load resistance sees RD in parallel with a constant 
current source, which ideally is an open.  Therefore:
zout(stage)  = RD (11-20)
Source Follower
Figure 11-22a shows a common-drain (CD) amplifi  er, also known as a source 
 follower.  The input signal drives the gate, and the output signal is coupled from 
the source to the load resistor. Like the emitter follower, the source follower 
has a voltage gain less than 1. The main advantage of the source follower is its 
very high input resistance and its low output resistance. Often, you will see a 
source follower used at the front end of a system, followed by bipolar stages of 
voltage gain.
 In Fig. 11-22b, the ac source resistance is defi  ned as:
rs 5 RSiRL
The voltage gain of a source follower is found by:
Av5vout___vin5id rs ________
vgs 1 id rs5gmvgsrs ___________
vgs 1 gmvgs rs where id5gmvgs
Which reduces to:
Av 5gmrs ________
1 1 gmrs(11-21)
Because the denominator is always greater than the numerator, the voltage gain is 
always less than 1.
 Fig. 11-22 b shows that the input impedance of the source follower is the 
same as the CS amplifi  er:

The resistance looking into the JFET’s source is:

Phase shift 5 0°444 Chapter 1111-8 The JFET Analog Switch
Besides the source follower, another major application of the JFET is analog 
switching.  In this application, the JFET acts as a switch that either transmits or 
blocks a small ac signal. To get this type of action, the gate-source voltage VGS has 
only two values: either zero or a value that is greater than VGS(off). In this way, the 
JFET operates either in the ohmic region or in the cutoff region.
Shunt Switch
Figure 11-27 a shows a JFET shunt switch.  The JFET is either conducting or cut 
off, depending on whether VGS is high or low. When VGS is high (0 V), the JFET 
operates in the ohmic region. When VGS is low, the JFET is cut off. Because of 
this, we can use Fig. 11-27 b as an equivalent circuit.
 For normal operation, the ac input voltage must be a small signal, typi-
cally less than 100 mV . A small signal ensures that the JFET remains in the ohmic 
region when the ac signal reaches its positive peak. Also, RD is much greater than 
RDS to ensure hard saturation:
RD . . RDS
 When VGS is high, the JFET operates in the ohmic region and the switch 
of Fig. 11-27 b is closed. Since RDS is much smaller than RD, vout is much smaller 
than vin. When VGS is low, the JFET cuts off and the switch of Fig. 11-27 b opens. 
In this case, vout 5 vin. Therefore, the JFET shunt switch either transmits the ac 
signal or blocks it.
Series Switch
Figure 11-27 c shows a JFET series switch,  and Fig. 11-27 d is its equivalent cir-
cuit. When VGS is high, the switch is closed and the JFET is equivalent to a resist-
ance of RDS. In this case, the output approximately equals the input. When VGS is 
low, the JFET is open and vout is approximately zero.GOOD TO KNOW
The ohmic resistance of a JFET 
can be determined for any value 
of VGS by using the following 
equation:
 R DS 5 RDS(on) }}1 2 VGS/VGS(off)
where RDS(on) is the ohmic 
 resistance when VDS is small 
and VGS 5 0 V.

 The on-off ratio of a switch is defi  ned as the maximum output voltage 
divided by the minimum output voltage:
On-off ratio  5   vout(max) _______ vout(min)   (11-23)
When a high on-off ratio is important, the JFET series switch is a better choice 
 because its on-off ratio is higher than that of the JFET shunt switch.
Chopper
Figure 11-28 shows a JFET chopper.  The gate voltage is a continuous square 
wave that continuously switches the JFET on and off. The input voltage is a rec-
tangular pulse with a value of VDC. Because of the square wave on the gate, the 
output is chopped  (switched on and off), as shown.
 A JFET chopper can use either a shunt or a series switch. Basically, the 
circuit converts a dc input voltage to a square-wave output. The peak value of the 
chopped output is VDC. As will be described later, a JFET chopper can be used to 
build a dc amplifi  er, a circuit that can amplify frequencies all the way down to zero 
frequencies.0 0VDC VDC

11-9 Other JFET Applications
A JFET cannot compete with a bipolar transistor for most amplifi  er applications. 
But its unusual properties make it a better choice in special applications. In this 
section, we discuss those applications where a JFET has a clear-cut advantage 
over the bipolar transistor.
Multiplexing
Multiplex  means “many into one.” Figure 11-31 shows an analog multiplexer,  a 
circuit that steers one or more of the input signals to the output line. Each JFET 
acts like a series switch. The control signals ( V1, V2, and V3) turn the JFETs on 
and off. When a control signal is high, its input signal is transmitted to the output.
 For instance, if V1 is high and the others are low, the output is a sine 
wave. If V2 is high and the others are low, the output is a triangular wave. When 
V3 is the high input, the output is a square wave. Normally, only one of the control 
signals is high; this ensures that only one of the input signals is transmitted to the 
output.SOLUTION   The output frequency is the same as the chopping or gate frequency:
fout 5 20 kHz
Since 50 V is much smaller than 10 k V, almost all the input voltage reaches the output:

We can build a direct-coupled amplifi  er by leaving out the coupling and bypass 
capacitors and connecting the output of each stage directly to the input of the next 
stage. In this way, dc voltages are coupled, as are ac voltages. Circuits that can 
amplify dc signals are called dc amplifi  ers.  The major disadvantage of direct cou-
pling is drift,  a slow shift in the fi  nal dc output voltage produced by minor changes 
in supply voltage, transistor parameters, and temperature variations.
 Figure 11-32 a shows one way to overcome the drift problem of direct 
coupling. Instead of using direct coupling, we use a JFET chopper to convert the 
input dc voltage to a square wave. The peak value of this square wave equals VDC. 
Because the square wave is an ac signal, we can use a conventional ac amplifi  er, 
one with coupling and bypass capacitors. The amplifi  ed output can then be peak-
detected to recover an amplifi  ed dc signal.
 A chopper amplifi  er can amplify low-frequency signals as well as dc 
signals. If the input is a low-frequency signal, it gets chopped into the ac wave-
form of Fig. 11-32 b. This chopped signal can be amplifi  ed by an ac amplifi  er. 
The amplifi  ed signal can then be peak-detected to recover the original input 
signal.
Buff  er Ampliﬁ  er
Figure 11-33 shows a buffer amplifi  er, a stage that isolates the preceding stage 
from the following stage. Ideally, a buffer should have a high input impedance. If 
it does, almost all the Thevenin voltage from stage A appears at the buffer input. 
The buffer should also have a low output impedance. This ensures that all its out-
put voltage reaches the input of stage B.0VDC VDCVDCVDC

HIGH zin LOW zoutFigure 11-33   Buff  er ampliﬁ  ers isolates stages A and B.JFETs 449 The source follower is an excellent buffer amplifi  er because of its high 
input impedance (well into the megohms at low frequencies) and its low out-
put impedance (typically a few hundred ohms). The high input impedance means 
light loading of stage A. The low output impedance means that the buffer can 
drive heavy loads (small load resistances).
Low-Noise Ampliﬁ  er
Noise  is any unwanted disturbance superimposed on a useful signal. Noise in-
terferes with the information contained in the signal. For instance, the noise in 
television receivers produces small white or black spots on the picture. Severe 
noise can wipe out the picture altogether. Similarly, the noise in radio receivers 
produces crackling and hissing, which sometimes completely masks the signal. 
Noise is independent of the signal because it exists even when the signal is off.
 The JFET is an outstanding low-noise device because it produces much 
less noise than a bipolar junction transistor. Low noise is very important at the 
front end of receivers because the later stages amplify front-end noise along with 
the signal. If we use a JFET amplifi  er at the front end, we get less amplifi  ed noise 
at the fi  nal output.
 Other circuits near the front end of receivers include frequency mixers
and oscillators.  A frequency mixer is a circuit that converts a higher frequency to 
a lower one. An oscillator is a circuit that generates an ac signal. JFETs are often 
used for VHF/UHF amplifi  ers, mixers, and oscillators. VHF  stands for “very high 
frequencies” (30 to 300 MHz), and UHF , for “ultra high frequencies”) (300 to 
3000 MHz).
Voltage-Controlled Resistance
When a JFET operates in the ohmic region, it usually has VGS 5 0 to ensure hard 
saturation. But there is an exception. It is possible to operate a JFET in the ohmic 
region with VGS values between 0 and VGS(off). In this case, the JFET can act like a 
voltage-controlled resistance.
 Figure 11-34 shows the drain curves of a 2N5951 near the origin with 
VDS less than 100 mV . In this region, the small-signal resistance rds is defi  ned as 
the drain voltage divided by the drain current:
rds 5   VDS ____ ID   (11-24)
In Fig. 11-34, you can see that rds depends on which VGS curve is used. For 
VGS 5 0, rds is minimum and equals RDS. As VGS becomes more negative, rds in-
creases and becomes greater than RDS.
 For instance, when VGS 5 0 in Fig. 11-34, we can calculate:
rds 5   100
 mV _______ 0.8 
mA   5 125 V
When VGS 5 2 2 V:
rds 5   100

mA   5 250 V
When VGS 5 2 4 V:
rds 5   100
 mV _______ 0.1 
mA   5 1 kV
This means that a JFET acts like a voltage-controlled resistance in the ohmic 
region.450 Chapter 11 Recall that a JFET is a symmetrical device at low frequencies since  either 
end can act like the source or the drain. This is why the drain curves of Fig. 11-34 
extend on both sides of the origin. This means that a JFET can be used as a voltage- 
controlled resistance for small ac signals, typically those with a peak-to-peak value 
of less than 200 mV . When it is used in this way, the JFET does not need a dc drain 
voltage from the supply because the small ac signal  supplies the drain voltage.
 Figure 11-35 a shows a shunt circuit where the JFET is used as a volt-
age-controlled resistance. This circuit is identical to the JFET shunt switch 0.8 mA

from 0 to a large negative value. Instead, VGS can vary continuously; that is, it can 
have any value between 0 and VGS(off). In this way, VGS controls the resistance of 
the JFET, which then changes the peak output voltage.
 Figure 11-35 b is a series circuit with the JFET used as a voltage- 
controlled resistance. The basic idea is the same. When you change VGS, you 
change the ac resistance of the JFET, which changes the peak output voltage.
 As calculated earlier, when VGS 5 0 V , the 2N5951 has a small-signal 
 resistance of:
rds 5 125 V
In Fig. 11-35 a, this means that the voltage divider produces a peak output  voltage 
of:

If VGS is changed to 22 V , rds increases to 250 V, and the peak output increases to:
Vp 5   250 V _______ 1.25 k V   (100 mV)  5 20 mV
When VGS is changed to 24 V , rds increases to 1 k V, and the peak output  increases 
to:

Automatic Gain Control
When a receiver is tuned from a weak to a strong station, the loudspeaker will 
blare (become loud) unless the volume is immediately decreased. The volume 
may also change because of fading, a decrease in signal caused by a change in 
the path between the transmitter and receiver. To prevent unwanted changes in the 
volume, most modern receivers use automatic gain control (AGC).
 Figure 11-36 illustrates the basic idea of AGC. An input signal vin passes 
through a JFET used as a voltage-controlled resistance. The signal is amplifi  ed to 
get the output voltage vout. The output signal is fed back to a negative peak detec-
tor. The output of this peak detector then supplies the VGS for the JFET.
 If the input signal suddenly increases by a large amount, the output volt-
age will increase. This means that a larger negative voltage comes out of the peak 
detector. Since VGS is more negative, the JFET has a higher ohmic resistance, 
which reduces the signal to the amplifi  er and decreases the output signal.

RDAMPLIFIER

PEAK
DETECTORFigure 11-36   Automatic gain control.452 Chapter 11 On the other hand, if the input signal fades, the output voltage decreases 
and the negative peak detector produces a smaller output. Since VGS is less  negative, 
the JFET transmits more signal voltage to the amplifi  er, which raises the fi  nal out-
put. Therefore, the effect of any sudden change in the input signal is offset or at least 
reduced by the AGC action.
Application Example 11-20
How does the circuit of Fig. 11-37 b control the gain of a receiver?
SOLUTION As shown earlier, the gm of a JFET decreases when VGS becomes more negative. The equation is:
gm 5 gm0  ( 1 2    VGS ______ VGS(off)   ) 
This is a linear equation. When it is graphed, it results in Fig. 11-37 a. For a JFET, gm reaches a maximum value when 
VGS 5 0. As VGS becomes more negative, the value of gm decreases. Since a CS amplifi  er has a voltage gain of:
Av 5 gmrd
we can control the voltage gain by controlling the value of gm.
 Figure 11-37 b shows how it’s done. A JFET amplifi  er is near the front end of a receiver. It has a voltage gain of gmrd. 
Subsequent stages amplify the JFET output. This amplifi  ed output goes into a negative peak detector that produces voltage 
VAGC. This negative voltage is applied to the gate of the CS amplifi  er.

Figure 11-38 is an example of a cascode amplifi  er. It can be shown that the overall 
voltage gain of this two-FET connection is:
Av 5 gmrd
This is the same voltage gain as for a CS amplifi  er.
 The advantage of the circuit is its low input capacitance, which is impor-
tant with VHF and UHF signals. At these higher frequencies, the input capacitance 
becomes a limiting factor on the voltage gain. With a cascode amplifi  er, the low 
input capacitance allows the circuit to amplify higher frequencies than are possible 
with only a CS amplifi  er. 
Current Sourcing
Suppose you have a load that requires a constant current. One solution is to use a 
shorted-gate JFET to supply the constant current. Figure 11-39 a shows the basic 
idea. If the Q point is in the active region, as shown in Fig. 11-39 b, the load 
current equals IDSS. If the load can tolerate the change in IDSS when JFETs are 
 replaced, the circuit is an excellent solution.
 On the other hand, if the constant load current must have a specifi  c value, 
we can use an adjustable source resistor, as shown in Fig. 11-39 c. The self-bias 
will produce negative values of VGS. By adjusting the resistor, we can set up dif-
ferent Q points, as shown in Fig. 11-39 d.
 Using JFETs like this is a simple way to produce a fi  xed load current, one 
that is constant even though the load resistance changes. In later chapters, we will 
discuss other ways to produce fi  xed load currents using op amps.
Current Limiting
Instead of sourcing current, a JFET can limit current. Figure 11-40 a shows how. 
In this application, the JFET operates in the ohmic region rather than the active 
region. To ensure operation in the ohmic region, the designer selects values to get 
the dc load line of Fig. 11-40 b. The normal Q point is in the ohmic region, and the 
normal load current is approximately VDD/RD.
 If the load becomes shorted, the dc load line becomes vertical. In this 
case, the Q point changes to the new position shown in Fig. 11-40 b. With this Q
point, the current is limited to IDSS. The point to remember is that a shorted load 
usually produces an excessive current. But with the JFET in series with the load, 
the current is limited to a safe value.
 When the receiver is tuned from a weak to a strong station, a larger signal is peak-detected and VAGC becomes more 
negative. This reduces the gain of the JFET amplifi  er. Conversely, if the signal fades, less AGC voltage is applied to the gate 
and the JFET stage produces a larger output signal.
 The overall effect of AGC is this: The fi  nal output signal changes, but not nearly as much as it would without AGC. 
For instance, in some AGC systems, an increase of 100 percent in the input signal results in an increase of less than 1 percent  
in the fi  nal output signal.

Conclusion
Look at Summary Table 11-3. Some of the terms are new and will be discussed 
in later chapters. The JFET buffer has the advantage of high input impedance and 
low output impedance. This is why the JFET is the natural choice at the front end 
of voltmeters, oscilloscopes, and other, similar equipment where you need high JFETs 455input resistances (10 M V or more). As a guide, the input resistance at the gate of 
a JFET is more than 100 M V.
 When a JFET is used as a small-signal amplifi  er, its output voltage is 
linearly related to the input voltage because only a small part of the transconduct-
ance curve is used. Near the front end of television and radio receivers, the signals 
are small. Therefore, JFETs are often used as RF amplifi  ers.
 But with larger signals, more of the transconductance curve is used, 
 resulting in square-law distortion. This nonlinear distortion is unwanted in an 
 amplifi  er. But in a frequency mixer, square-law distortion has a big advantage. 
This is why the JFET is preferred to the bipolar junction transistor for FM and 
television mixer applications.
 As indicated in Summary Table 11-3, JFETs are also useful in AGC ampli-
fi ers, cascode amplifi  ers, choppers, voltage-controlled resistors, audio amplifi  ers, 
and oscillators.
11-10  Reading Data Sheets
JFET data sheets are similar to bipolar junction data sheets. You will fi  nd max-
imum ratings, dc characteristics, ac characteristics, mechanical data, and so on. 
As usual, a good place to start is with the maximum ratings because these are the 
limits on the JFET currents, voltages, and other quantities.
Breakdown Ratings
As shown in Fig. 11-41, the data sheet of the MPF102 gives these maximum  ratings:
VDS 25 V
VGS 225 V
PD 350 mW
As usual, a conservative design includes a safety factor for all of these maximum 
ratings.
 As discussed earlier, the derating factor tells you how much to reduce the 
power rating of a device. The derating factor of an MPF102 is given as 2.8 mW/°C. 
This means that you have to reduce the power rating by 2.8 mW for each degree 
above 25°C.Summary Table 11-3  FET Applications

Two of the most important pieces of information on the data sheet of a deple-
tion-mode device are the maximum drain current and the gate-source cutoff volt-
age. These values are given on the data sheet of the MPF102:
Symbol Minimum Maximum
VGS(off  ) — 28 V
IDSS 2 mA 20 mA
Notice the 10:1 spread in IDSS. This large spread is one of the reasons for using 
ideal approximations with a preliminary analysis of JFET circuits. Another reason 
for using ideal approximations is this: Data sheets often omit values, so you really 
have no idea what some values may be. In the case of the MPF102, the minimum 
value of VGS(off) is not listed on the data sheet.
 Another important static characteristic of a JFET is IGSS, which is the 
gate current when the gate-source junction is reverse biased. This current value 
 allows us to determine the dc input resistance of the JFET. As shown on the data 
sheet, a MPF102 has an IGSS value of 2 nAdc when VGS 5 215 V . Under these 
conditions, the gate-source resistance is R 5 15 V /2 nA  5 7500 M V.
Table of JFETs
Table 11-4 shows a sample of different JFETs. The data are sorted in ascending 
order for gm0. The data sheets for these JFETs show that some are optimized for 
use at audio frequencies and others for use at RF frequencies. The last three JFETs 
are optimized for switching applications.
 JFETs are small-signal devices because their power dissipation is usu-
ally a watt or less. In audio applications, JFETs are often used as source followers. Table 11-4     JFET Sampler

11-11  JFET Testing
The data sheet for the MPF102 shows a maximum gate current IG of 10 mA. This 
is the maximum forward gate-to-source or gate-to-drain current the JFET can han-
dle. This can occur if the gate to channel pn junction becomes forward  biased. If 
you are testing a JFET using an ohmmeter or digital multimeter on the diode test 
range, be sure that your meter doesn’t cause excessive gate current. Many analog 
VOMs will provide approximately 100 mA in the R 3 1 range. The R 3 100 range 
generally results in a current of 1 –2 mA. Most DMMs output a constant 1–2 mA 
of current when in the diode test range. This should allow safe testing of a JFET’s 
gate-to-source and gate-to-drain pn junctions. To check the JFET’s drain-to-source 
channel resistance, connect the gate lead to the source lead. Otherwise, you will get 
erratic measurements due to the electric fi  eld produced in the channel.
 If you have a semiconductor curve tracer available, the JFET can be 
tested to display its drain curves. A simple test circuit using Multisim, shown in 
Fig. 11-42 a, can also be used to display one drain curve at a time. By using the 
x-y display capability of most oscilloscopes, a drain curve similar to Fig. 11-42 b 
can be displayed. By varying the reverse-bias voltage of V1, you can determine the 
approximate IDSS and VGS(off) values. 
 For example, as shown in Fig. 11-42 a, the oscilloscope’s y-input is con-
nected across a 10- V source resistor. With the oscilloscope’s vertical input set to 
50 mV/division, this results in a vertical drain current measurement of:
ID 5 50 mV/div.}}10 V 5 5 mA/ div
 With V1 adjusted to 0 V , the resulting ID value ( IDSS) is approximately 
12 mA. VGS(off) can be found by increasing V1 until ID is zero.

Summary
SEC. 11-1 BASIC IDEAS
The junction FET, abbreviated JFET,  
has a source, gate, and drain. The 
JFET has two diodes: the gate-
source diode and the gate-drain 
diode. For normal operation, the 
gate-source diode is reverse biased. 
Then, the gate voltage controls the 
drain current.
SEC. 11-2 DRAIN CURVES
Maximum drain current occurs when 
the gate-source voltage is zero. The 
pinchoff   voltage separates the ohmic 
and active regions for VGS 5 0. The 
gate-source cutoff   voltage has the 
same magnitude as the pinchoff   
 voltage. VGS(off  ) turns the JFET off  .
SEC. 11-3  THE TRANSCON-
DUCTANCE CURVE
This is a graph of drain current ver-
sus gate-source voltage. The drain 
current increases more rapidly as 
VGS  approaches zero. Because the 
equation for drain current contains a 
squared quantity, JFETs are referred 
to as square-law devices.  The normal-
ized transconduc tance curve shows 
that ID equals one-quarter of maximum 
when VGS equals half of cutoff  .
SEC. 11-4  BIASING IN THE 
OHMIC REGION
Gate bias is used to bias a JFET in the 
ohmic region. When it operates in the 
ohmic region, a JFET is equivalent to 
a small resistance of RDS. To ensure 
 operation in the ohmic region, the JFET is driven into hard saturation by 
using VGS 5 0 and ID(sat) , , IDSS.
SEC. 11-5  BIASING IN THE 
 ACTIVE REGION
When the gate voltage is much larger 
than VGS, voltage-divider bias can set 
up a stable Q point in the active re-
gion. When positive and negative sup-
ply voltages are available, two-supply 
source bias can be used to swamp out 
the variations in VGS and set up a sta-
ble Q point. When supply voltages are 
not large, current-source bias can be 
used to get a stable Q point. Self-bias 
is used only with small-signal ampliﬁ  -
ers because the Q point is less stable 
than with the other biasing methods.
SEC. 11-6  TRANSCONDUC- 
TANCE
Transconductance gm tells us how 
eff ective the gate voltage is in con-
trolling the drain current. The quantity 
gm is the slope of the transconduct-
ance curve, which increases as VGS 
approaches zero. Data sheets may 
list gfs and siemens, which are equiv-
alent to gm and mhos.
SEC. 11-7 JFET AMPLIFIERS
A CS ampliﬁ  er has a voltage gain of 
gmrd and produces an inverted out-
put signal. One of the most important 
uses of a JFET ampliﬁ  er is the source 
follower, which is often used at the 
front end of systems because of its 
high input resistance.
SEC. 11-8  THE JFET ANALOG 
SWITCH
In this application, the JFET acts 
like a switch t hat either transmits or blocks a small ac signal. To 
get this type of action, the JFET is 
biased into hard saturation or cut-
off ,  depending on whether VGS is 
high or low. JFET shunt and series 
switches are used. The series type 
has a higher on-off   ratio.
SEC. 11-9  OTHER JFET 
APPLICATIONS
JFETs are used in multiplexers 
(ohmic), chopper ampliﬁ  ers (ohmic), 
buff er ampliﬁ  ers (active), voltage- 
controlled resistors (ohmic), AGC 
circuits (ohmic), cascode ampliﬁ  ers 
(active), current sources (active), and 
current limiters (ohmic and active).
SEC. 11-10  READING DATA 
SHEETS
JFETs are mainly small-signal 
 devices because most JFETs have a 
power rating of less than 1 W. When 
reading data sheets, start with the 
maximum ratings. Sometimes, data 
sheets omit the minimum VGS(off  ) or 
other parameters. The large spread 
in JFET parameters justiﬁ  es using 
ideal approximations for preliminary 
analysis and troubleshooting.
SEC. 11-11 JFET TESTING
JFETs can be tested using an 
 ohmmeter or DMM on the diode 
test range. Care must be taken not 
to exceed the JFET’s current limits. 
Curve tracers and circuits can be 
used to display a JFET’s dynamic 
characteristics.

MOSFETs
The metal-oxide semiconductor FET,  or MOSFET,  has a source, 
gate, and drain. The MOSFET diff  ers from the JFET, however, in 
that the gate is insulated from the channel. Because of this, the 
gate current is even smaller than it is in a JFET. 
There are two kinds of MOSFETs, the depletion-mode type 
and the enhancement-mode type. The enhancement-mode 
MOSFET is widely used in both discrete and integrated circuits. 
In discrete circuits, the main use is in power switching, which 
means turning large currents on and off  . In integrated circuits, 
the main use is in digital switching, the basic process behind 
modern computers. Although their use has declined, depletion-
mode MOSFETs are still found in high-frequency front-end 
communications circuits as RF ampliﬁ  ers.

Figure 12-1 shows a depletion-mode MOSFET,  a piece of n material with an 
insulated gate on the left and a p region on the right. The p region is called the 
substrate.  Electrons fl  owing from source to drain must pass through the narrow 
channel between the gate and the p substrate.
A thin layer of silicon dioxide (SiO 2) is deposited on the left side of the 
channel. Silicon dioxide is the same as glass, which is an insulator. In a MOSFET, 
the gate is metallic. Because the metallic gate is insulated from the channel, neg-
ligible gate current fl  ows even when the gate voltage is positive.
Figure 12-2 a shows a depletion-mode MOSFET with a negative gate 
voltage. The VDD supply forces free electrons to fl  ow from source to drain. These 
electrons fl  ow through the narrow channel on the left of the p substrate. As with 
a JFET, the gate voltage controls the width of the channel. The more negative 
the gate voltage, the smaller the drain current. When the gate voltage is negative 
enough, the drain current is cut off. Therefore, the operation of a depletion-mode 
MOSFET is similar to that of a JFET when VGS is negative.
Since the gate is insulated, we can also use a positive input voltage, as 
shown in Fig. 12-2 b. The positive gate voltage increases the number of free elec-
trons fl  owing through the channel. The more positive the gate voltage, the greater 
the conduction from source to drain.
12-2  D-MOSFET Curves
Figure 12-3 a shows the set of drain curves for a typical n-channel, depletion-mode 
MOSFET. Notice that the curves above VGS 5 0 are positive and the curves below 
VGS 5 0 are negative. As with a JFET, the bottom curve is for VGS 5 VGS(off) and 
the drain current will be approximately zero. As shown, when VGS 5 0 V , the drain 
current will equal IDSS. This demonstrates that the depletion-mode MOSFET, or 
D-MOSFET, is a normally on  device. When VGS is made negative, the drain cur-
rent will be reduced. In contrast to an n-channel JFET, the n-channel D-MOSFET 
can have VGS made positive and still function properly. This is because there is 
no pn junction to become forward biased. When VGS becomes positive, ID will 
increase following the square-law equation:

GOOD TO KNOW
Like a JFET, a depletion-mode 
MOSFET is considered a nor-
mally on device. This is because 
both devices have drain current 
when VGS 5 0 V. Recall that 
for a JFET, IDSS is the maximum 
possible drain current. With a 
depletion-mode MOSFET, the 
drain current can exceed IDSS if 
the gate voltage is of the correct 
polarity to increase the number 
of charge carriers in the channel. 
For an n-channel D-MOSFET, ID 
is greater than IDSS when VGS is 
positive.

When VGS is positive, the D-MOSFET is operating in the enhancement mode. Like 
the JFET, the D-MOSFET curves display an ohmic region, a current-source region, 
and a cutoff region.
Figure 12-3 b is the transconductance curve for a D-MOSFET. Again, 
IDSS is the drain current with the gate shorted to the source. IDSS is no longer the 
maximum possible drain current. The parabolic transconductance curve follows 
the same square-law relation that exists with a JFET. As a result, the analysis of a 
depletion-mode MOSFET is almost identical to that of a JFET circuit. The major 
difference is enabling VGS to be either negative or positive.
There is also a p-channel D-MOSFET. It consists of a drain-to-source 
p-channel, along with an n-type substrate. Once again, the gate is insulated 
from the channel. The action of a p-channel MOSFET is complementary to the 
n-channel MOSFET. The schematic symbols for both n-channel and p-channel 
D-MOSFETs are shown in Fig. 12-4.(a)

Ampliﬁ  ers
A depletion-mode MOSFET is unique because it can operate with a positive or 
a negative gate voltage. Because of this, we can set its Q point at VGS 5 0 V , as 
shown in Fig. 12-5 a. When the input signal goes positive, it increases ID above 
IDSS. When the input signal goes negative, it decreases ID below IDSS. Because 
there is no pn junction to forward bias, the input resistance of the MOSFET 
 remains very high. Being able to use zero VGS allows us to build the very simple 
bias circuit of Fig. 12-5 b. Because IG is zero, VGS 5 0 V and ID 5 IDSS. The drain 
voltage is:
VDS 5 VDD 2 IDSS RD (12-2)
Due to the fact that a D-MOSFET is a normally on device, it is also pos-
sible to use self-bias by adding a source resistor. The operation becomes the same 
as a self-biased JFET circuit.

PRACTICE PROBLEM 12-2   In Fig. 12-6, if the MOSFET’s gmo value is 
3000 /H9262S, what is the value of vout?
As shown by Example 12-2, the D-MOSFET has a relatively low volt-
age gain. One of the major advantages of this device is its extremely high input 
resistance. The input resistance remains high when VGS is positive or negative. 
This allows us to use this device when circuit loading could be a problem. Also, 
MOSFETs have excellent low-noise properties because no electron-hole pair 
combinations are required for current fl  ow as in BJTs. This is a defi  nite advantage 
for any stage near the front end of a system where the signal is weak. This is very 
common in many types of electronic communications circuits.
Some D-MOSFETs, as shown in Fig. 12-7, are dual-gate devices. One 
gate can serve as the input signal point, while the other gate can be connected to an 
automatic gain control dc voltage. This allows the voltage gain of the  MOSFET to 
be controlled and varied depending on the input signal strength.Figure 12-6   D-MOSFET ampliﬁ  er.

MOSFET
The depletion-mode MOSFET was part of the evolution toward the  enhancement- 
mode MOSFET,  abbreviated E-MOSFET.  Without the E-MOSFET, the personal 
computers that are now so widespread would not exist.
The Basic Idea
Figure 12-8 a shows an E-MOSFET. The p substrate now extends all the way to the 
silicon dioxide. As you can see, there no longer is an n channel between the source 
and the drain. How does an E-MOSFET work? Figure 12-8 b shows normal biasing 
polarities. When the gate voltage is zero, the current between source and drain is 
zero. For this reason, an E-MOSFET is normally off  when the gate voltage is zero.
The only way to get current is with a positive gate voltage. When the 
gate is positive, it attracts free electrons into the p region. The free electrons re-
combine with the holes next to the silicon dioxide. When the gate voltage is posi-
tive enough, all the holes touching the silicon dioxide are fi  lled, and free electrons 
begin to fl  ow from the source to the drain. The effect is the same as creating a 
thin layer of n-type material next to the silicon dioxide. This thin conducting layer vout

from the source to the drain.
The minimum VGS that creates the n-type inversion layer is called the 
threshold voltage,  symbolized by VGS(th). When VGS is less than VGS(th), the drain 
current is zero. When VGS is greater than VGS(th), an n-type inversion layer con-
nects the source to the drain and the drain current can fl  ow. Typical values of 
VGS(th) for small-signal devices are from 1 to 3 V.
The JFET is referred to as a depletion-mode device  because its conduc-
tivity depends on the action of depletion layers. The E-MOSFET is classifi  ed as 
an enhancement-mode device  because a gate voltage greater than the threshold 
voltage enhances its conductivity. With zero gate voltage, a JFET is on, whereas 
an E-MOSFET is off. Therefore, the E-MOSFET is considered to be a normally 
off device.
Drain Curves
A small-signal E-MOSFET has a power rating of 1 W or less. Figure 12-9 a
shows a set of drain curves for a typical small-signal E-MOSFET. The low-
est curve is the  VGS(th) curve. When VGS is less than VGS(th), the drain current is 
approximately zero. When VGS is greater than VGS(th), the device turns on and the 
drain current is controlled by the gate voltage.
 The almost-vertical part of the graph is the ohmic region, and the almost-
horizontal parts are the active region. When biased in the ohmic region, the 
E-MOSFET is equivalent to a resistor. When biased in the active region, it is 
equivalent to a current source. Although the E-MOSFET can operate in the 
active region, the main use is the ohmic region.
 Figure 12-9 b shows a typical transconductance curve. There is no drain 
current until VGS 5 VGS(th). The drain current then increases rapidly until it reaches 
the saturation current ID(sat). Beyond this point, the device is biased in the ohmic 
region. Therefore, ID cannot increase, even though VGS increases. To ensure hard sat-
uration, a gate voltage of VGS(on) well above VGS(th) is used, as shown in Fig. 12-9 b.
Schematic Symbol
When VGS 5 0, the E-MOSFET is off because there is no conducting channel 
between source and drain. The schematic symbol of Fig. 12-10 a has a broken 
channel line to indicate this normally off condition. As you know, a gate voltage 
greater than the threshold voltage creates an n-type inversion layer that connects 
the source to the drain. The arrow points to this inversion layer, which acts like an 
n channel when the device is conducting.(a)ID

GOOD TO KNOW
With the E-MOSFET, VGS has to 
be greater than VGS(th) to get any 
drain current at all. Therefore, 
when E-MOSFETs are biased, 
self-bias, current-source bias, 
and zero bias cannot be used 
because these forms of bias de-
pend on the depletion mode of 
operation. This leaves gate bias, 
voltage-divider bias, and source 
bias as the means for biasing 
E-MOSFETs.
(a) (b)Figure 12-10   EMOS schematic 
symbols: ( a) N-channel device; 
(b) p-channel device.478 Chapter 12There is also a p-channel E-MOSFET. The schematic symbol is similar, 
except that the arrow points outward, as shown in Fig. 12-10 b.
The p-channel E-MOSFET is also a normally off enhancement-mode 
device. To turn on a p-channel E-MOSFET, the gate must be made negative with 
respect to the source. The – VGS value must reach or exceed the – VGS(th) value for 
conduction. When this occurs, a p-type inversion layer is formed with holes being 
the majority carriers. The n-channel E-MOSFET uses electrons as the majority 
carriers which have higher mobility than the p-channel holes. This results in a 
lower RDS(on) and higher switching speeds for the n-channel E-MOSFET.
Maximum Gate-Source Voltage
MOSFETs have a thin layer of silicon dioxide, an insulator that prevents gate 
 current for positive as well as negative gate voltages. This insulating layer is kept 
as thin as possible to give the gate more control over the drain current. Because the 
 insulating layer is so thin, it is easily destroyed by excessive gate-source voltage.
For instance, a 2N7000 has a VGS(max) rating of 620 V. If the gate-source 
voltage becomes more positive than 120 V or more negative than 220 V, the thin 
insulating layer will be destroyed.
Aside from directly applying an excessive VGS, you can destroy the thin 
insulating layer in more subtle ways. If you remove or insert a MOSFET into a 
circuit while the power is on, transient voltages caused by inductive kickback may 
exceed the VGS(max) rating. Even picking up a MOSFET may deposit enough static 
charge to exceed the VGS(max) rating. This is the reason why MOSFETs are often 
shipped with a wire ring around the leads, or wrapped in tin foil, or inserted into 
conductive foam.
Some MOSFETs are protected by a built-in zener diode in parallel with 
the gate and the source. The zener voltage is less than the VGS(max) rating. There-
fore, the zener diode breaks down before any damage to the thin insulating layer 
occurs. The disadvantage of these internal zener diodes is that they reduce the 
MOSFET’s high-input resistance. The trade-off is worth it in some applications 
because expensive MOSFETs are easily destroyed without zener protection.
In conclusion, MOSFET devices are delicate and can be easily  destroyed. 
You have to handle them carefully. Furthermore, you should never  connect or 
disconnect them while the power is on. Finally, before you pick up a MOSFET 
device, you should ground your body by touching the chassis of the equipment 
you are working on.
12-5  The Ohmic Region
Although the E-MOSFET can be biased in the active region, this is seldom done 
because it is primarily a switching device. The typical input voltage is either low or 
high. Low voltage is 0 V , and high voltage is VGS(on), a value specifi  ed on data sheets.
Drain-Source on Resistance
When an E-MOSFET is biased in the ohmic region, it is equivalent to a resistance 
of RDS(on). Almost all data sheets will list the value of this resistance at a specifi  c 
drain current and gate-source voltage.
 Figure 12-11 illustrates the idea. There is a Qtest point in the ohmic region 
of the VGS 5 VGS(on) curve. The manufacturer measures ID(on) and VDS(on) at this 
Qtest point. From this, the manufacturer calculates the value of RDS(on) using this 
defi nition:
RDS(on) 5  VDS(on) ______ ID(on)   (12-3)GOOD TO KNOW
E-MOSFETs are often used in 
Class-AB amplifiers, where the 
E-MOSFET is biased with a 
value of VGS slightly exceeding 
that of VGS(th). This “trickle bias” 
prevents crossover distortion. 
D-MOSFETs are not suitable 
for use in Class-B or Class-AB 
amplifiers because a large 
drain current flows for VGS5 0 V.MOSFETs 479For instance, at the test point, a VN2406L has VDS(on) 5 1 V and ID(on) 5 100 mA. 
Using Eq. (12-3):
RDS(on) 5   1 V _______ 100 mA   5 10 V
 Figure 12-12 shows the data sheet of a 2N7000 n-channel E-MOSFET. 
 Notice that this E-MOSFET can also be packaged as a surface-mount device. 
Also, make note of the internal diode between the drain and source leads. This 
diode is referred to as a parasitic body-diode , and is a result of the manufacturing of 
the device. Minimum, typical, and maximum values are listed for this E-MOSFET. 
These device specifi  cations often have a wide range of values.
Table of E-MOSFETs
Table 12-1 is a sample of small-signal E-MOSFETs. The typical VGS(th) values are 
1.5 to 3 V . The RDS(on) values are 0.3 to 28 V, which means that the E-MOSFET 
has a low resistance when biased in the ohmic region. When biased at cutoff, it has 
a very high resistance, approximately an open circuit. Therefore, E-MOSFETs 
have excellent on-off ratios.ID

and the drain cutoff voltage is VDD. Figure 12-13 b shows the dc load line between 
a saturation current of ID(sat) and a cutoff voltage of VDD.
When VGS 5 0, the Q point is at the lower end of the dc load line. When 
VGS 5 VGS(on), the Q point is at the upper end of the load line. When the Q point 
is below the Qtest point, as shown in Fig. 12-13 b, the device is biased in the ohmic 
region. Stated another way, an E-MOSFET is biased in the ohmic region when

What does the circuit of Fig. 12-16 a do if a coil current of 30 mA or more closes 
the relay contacts?
SOLUTION   The E-MOSFET is being used to turn a relay on and off. The 
15 V resistor represents a variety of possible load types, including a single-phase 
ac motor. Since the relay coil has a resistance of 500 V, the saturation current is:
ID(sat) 5   24 V ______ 500 V   5 48 mA
Because this is less than the ID(on) of the VN2406L, the device has a resistance of 
only 10 V (see Table 12-1).
 Figure 12-16 b shows the equivalent circuit for high VGS. The current 
through the relay coil is approximately 48 mA, more than enough to close 
the relay. When the relay is closed, the contact circuit looks like Fig. 12-16 c. 
 Therefore, the fi  nal load current is 8 A (120 V divided by 15 V).
 In Figure 12-16 a, an input voltage of only 12.5 V and almost zero input 
current controls a load voltage of 120 V ac and a load current of 8 A. The input 
signal could be from a digital control circuit or even a microcontroller chip. A cir-
cuit like this is also useful with remote control. The input voltage could be a signal 
that has been transmitted a long distance through copper wire, fi  ber-optic cable, or VDD

Why has the E-MOSFET revolutionized the computer industry? Because of its 
threshold voltage, it is ideal for use as a switching device. When the gate  voltage 
is well above the threshold voltage, the device switches from cutoff to saturation. 
This off-on action is the key to building computers. When you study computer 
 circuits, you will see how a typical computer uses millions of E-MOSFETs as 
off-on switches to process data. ( Data  include numbers, text, graphics, and all 
other  information that can be coded as binary numbers.)
Analog, Digital, and Switching Circuits
The word analog  means “continuous,” like a sine wave. When we speak of an 
analog signal, we are talking about signals that continuously change in voltage 
like the one in Fig. 12-17 a. The signal does not have to be sinusoidal. As long 
outer space. The diode D1 in Fig. 12-16 a is called a  free-wheeling diode . When the 
MOSFET turns off, the magnetic fi  eld around the relay coil quickly collapses. This 
causes a large induced voltage across the coil, which is series aiding with the 124-V 
supply. This could damage the MOSFET. Placing a diode in parallel with the coil 
limits the induced voltage to approximately 0.7 V and protects the MOSFET.+24 V

 referred to as an analog signal.
The word digital  refers to a discontinuous signal. This means that the sig-
nal jumps between two distinct voltage levels like the waveform of Fig. 12-17 b. 
Digital signals like these are the kind of signals inside computers. These signals 
are computer codes that represent numbers, letters, and other symbols.
The word switching  is a broader word than digital.  Switching circuits 
include digital circuits as a subset. In other words, switching circuits can also 
refer to circuits that turn on motors, lamps, heaters, and other heavy-current 
devices.
Passive-Load Switching
Figure 12-18 shows an E-MOSFET with a passive load. The word passive  refers 
to ordinary resistors like RD. In this circuit, vin is either low or high. When vin is 
low, the MOSFET is cut off, and vout equals the supply voltage VDD. When vin is 
high, the MOSFET saturates and vout drops to a low value. For the circuit to work 
properly, the drain saturation current ID(sat) has to be less than ID(on) when the 
input voltage is equal to or greater than VGS(on). This is equivalent to saying that 
the  resistance in the ohmic region has to be much smaller than the passive drain 
 resistance. In symbols:
RDS(on) , , RD
A circuit like Fig. 12-18 is the simplest computer circuit that can be built. It is 
called an inverter  because the output voltage is the opposite of the input voltage. 
When the input voltage is low, the output voltage is high. When the input voltage 
is high, the output voltage is low. Great accuracy is not necessary when analyzing 
switching circuits. All that matters is that the input and output voltages can be 
easily recognized as low or high.
Active-Load Switching
Integrated circuits (ICs) consist of thousands of microscopically small transis-
tors, either bipolar or MOS. The earliest integrated circuits used passive-load 
resistors like the one of Fig. 12-18. But a passive-load resistor presents a major 
problem. It is physically much larger than a MOSFET. Because of this, inte-
grated circuits with passive-load resistors were too big until somebody invented 
active-load resistors.  This greatly reduced the size of integrated circuits and led 
to the personal computers that we have today.
The key idea was to get rid of passive-load resistors. Figure 12-19 a shows 
the invention: active-load switching.  The lower MOSFET acts like a switch, but 
the upper MOSFET acts like a large value resistor. Notice that the upper MOS FET (a)tv

being monitored and controlled 
by a system. Some examples of 
analog inputs and outputs are

For the circuit to work properly, the RD of the upper MOSFET has to be 
large compared to the RDS(on) of the lower MOSFET. For instance, if the upper 
MOSFET acts like an RD of 5 k V and the lower one like an RDS(on) of 667 V, as 
shown in Fig. 12-19 b, then the output voltage will be low.
Figure 12-19 c shows how to calculate the RD of the upper MOSFET. 
 Because VGS 5 VDS, each operating point of this MOSFET has to fall along the 
two-terminal curve shown in Fig. 12-19 c. If you check each plotted point on this 
two-terminal curve, you will see that VGS 5 VDS.
The two-terminal curve of Fig. 12-19 c means that the upper MOSFET 
acts like a resistance of RD. The value of RD will change slightly for the different 
points. For instance, at the highest point shown in Fig. 12-19 c, the two-terminal 
curve has ID 5 3 mA and VDS 5 15 V. Using Eq. (12-6), we can calculate:
RD 5   15 V _____ 3 mA   5 5 kV
The next point down has these approximate values: ID 5 1.6 mA and VDS 5 10 V . 
Therefore:
RD 5   10 V _______ 1.6 mA   5 6.25 k V
By a similar calculation, the lowest point where VDS 5 5 V and ID 5 0.7 mA 
results in RD 5 7.2 k V.
If the lower MOSFET has the same set of drain curves as the upper one, 
then the lower MOSFET has an RDS(on) of:
RDS(on) 5   2 V _____ 3 mA   5 667 V
This is the value shown in Fig. 12-19 b.
As already indicated, exact values don’t matter with digital switching 
circuits as long as the voltages can be easily distinguished as low or high. There-
fore, the exact value of RD does not matter. It can be 5, 6.25, or 7.2 k V. Any of 
these values is large enough to produce a low output voltage in Fig. 12-19 b.vinvout+VDD

Conclusion
Active-load resistors are necessary with digital ICs because a small physical size 
is important with digital ICs. The designer makes sure that the RD of the upper 
 MOSFET is large compared to the RD(on) of the lower MOSFET. When you see 
a circuit like Fig. 12-19 a, all you have to remember is the basic idea: The circuit 
acts like a resistance of RD in series with a switch. As a result, the output voltage 
is either high or low.

SOLUTION   When the input voltage is low, the lower MOSFET is open and 
the output voltage is pulled up to the supply voltage:

When the input voltage is high, the lower MOSFET has a resistance of 50 V. In 
this case, the output voltage is pulled down toward ground:

With active-load switching, the current drain with a low output is approximately 
equal to ID(sat). This may create a problem with battery-operated equipment. One 
way to reduce the current drain of a digital circuit is with complementary MOS 
(CMOS) . In this approach, the IC designer combines n-channel and p-channel 
MOSFETs.
Figure 12-21 a shows the idea. Q1 is a p-channel MOSFET and Q2 is an 
n-channel MOSFET. These two devices are complementary; that is, they have 
equal and opposite values of VGS(th), VGS(on), ID(on), and so on. The circuit is similar 
to a Class-B amplifi  er because one MOSFET conducts while the other is off.
Basic Action
When a CMOS circuit like Fig. 12-21 a is used in a switching application, the 
input voltage is either high ( 1VDD) or low (0 V). When the input voltage is high, 
Q1 is off and Q2 is on. In this case, the shorted Q2 pulls the output voltage down to 
ground. On the other hand, when the input voltage is low, Q1 is on and Q2 is off. 
Now, the shorted Q1 pulls the output voltage up to 1VDD. Since the output voltage 
is inverted, the circuit is called a CMOS inverter.
Figure 12-21 b shows how the output voltage varies with the input volt-
age. When the input voltage is zero, the output voltage is high. When the input 
voltage is high, the output voltage is low. Between the two extremes, there is 
When the input voltage is high:
vout 5   500 V ______ 2.5 k V   (10 V)  5 2 V
If you compare this to the preceding example, you can see that the on-off ratio is 
not as good. But with digital circuits, a high on-off ratio is not important. In this 
 example, the output voltage is either 2 or 10 V . These voltages are easily distin-
guishable as low or high.

 MOSFETs have equal resistances and the output voltage equals VDD/2.
Power Consumption
The main advantage of CMOS is its extremely low-power consumption. Because 
both MOSFETs are in series in Fig. 12-21 a, the quiescent current drain is deter-
mined by the nonconducting device. Since its resistance is in the megohms, the 
quiescent  (idling) power consumption approaches zero.
The power consumption increases when the input signal switches from 
low to high, and vice versa. The reason is this: At the midway point in a transition 
from low to high or vice versa, both MOSFETs are on. This means that the drain 
current temporarily increases. Since the transition is very rapid, only a brief pulse 
of current occurs. The product of the drain supply voltage and the brief pulse of 
current means that the average dynamic  power consumption is greater than the 
quiescent power consumption. In other words, a CMOS device dissipates more 
average power when it has transitions than when it is quiescent.
Since the pulses of current are very short, however, the average power 
 dissipation is very low even when CMOS devices are switching states. In fact, 
the average power consumption is so small that CMOS circuits are often used for 
 battery-powered applications such as calculators, digital watches, and hearing aids.
Example 12-8
The MOSFETs of Fig. 12-22 a have RDS(on) 5 100 V and RDS(off) 5 1 M V. What does the output waveform look like?
SOLUTION  The input signal is a rectangular pulse that switches from 0 to 115 V at point A and from 115 V to 0 at 
point B. Before point A in time, Q1 is on and Q2 is off. Since Q1 has a resistance of 100 V compared to a resistance of 1 M V
for Q2, the output voltage is pulled up to 115 V .
Between points A and B, the input voltage is 115 V. This cuts off Q1 and turns on Q2. In this case, the low  resistance 
of Q2 pulls the output voltage down to approximately zero. Figure 12-22 b shows the output waveform.

In earlier discussions, we emphasized small-signal E-MOSFETs, that is, low-
power MOSFETs. Although some discrete low-power E-MOSFETs are commer-
cially available (see Table 12-1), the major use of low-power EMOS is with  digital 
integrated circuits.
 High-power EMOS is different. With high-power EMOS, the E-MOSFET 
is a discrete device widely used in applications that control motors, lamps, disk 
drives, printers, power supplies, and so on. In these applications, the E-MOSFET 
is called a power FET.
Discrete Devices
Manufacturers are producing different devices such as VMOS, TMOS, hexFET, 
trench MOSFET, and waveFET. All these power FETs use different channel ge-
ometries to increase their maximum ratings. These devices have current ratings 
from 1 A to more than 200 A, and power ratings from 1 W to more than 500 W.
 Figure 12-23 a shows the structure of an enhancement-type MOSFET in 
an integrated circuit. The source is on the left, the gate in the middle, and the drain 
on the right. Free electrons fl  ow horizontally from the source to the drain when 
VGS is greater than VGS(th). This structure limits the maximum current because free 
electrons must fl  ow along the narrow inversion layer, symbolized by the dashed 
line. Because the channel is so narrow, conventional MOS devices have small 
drain currents and low-power ratings.
 Figure 12-23 b shows the structure of a vertical MOS (VMOS)  device. It 
has two sources at the top, which are usually connected, and the substrate acts like 
the drain. When VGS is greater than VGS(th), free electrons fl  ow vertically down-
ward from the two sources to the drain. Because the conducting channel is much

structure.492 Chapter 12wider along both sides of the V groove, the current can be much larger. This 
 enables the VMOS device to act as a power FET.
Parasitic Elements
Figure 12-24 a shows the structure of another vertically orientated power MOS-
FET called a UMOSFET. This device implements a U-groove at the bottom of the 
gate region. This structure results in a higher channel density which reduces the 
on-resistance.
As in most other power MOSFETs, the four-layer structure includes n1, 
p, n2, and n1 regions. Because of the layered semiconductor structure, parasitic 
elements exist. One such parasitic element is an npn BJT between the source and 
the drain. As shown in Fig. 12-24 b, the p-type body region becomes the base, the 
n1 source region becomes the emitter, and the n-type drain region becomes the 
collector.
So what is the signifi  cance of this effect? Early versions of power 
MOSFETs were susceptible to voltage breakdown under high rates of drain-to-
source voltage rise ( dV/dt ) and voltage transients. When this occurs, the parasitic 
base-collector junction capacitance quickly charges up. This acts like base current 
and turns on the parasitic transistor. When the parasitic transistor suddenly turns 
on, the device will go into an avalanche breakdown state. The MOSFET will be 
destroyed if the drain current is not externally limited. To prevent the parasitic 
BJT from turning on, the n1 source region is shorted to the p-type body region by 
source metallization. Notice in Fig. 12-24 b how the source region is connected to 
both the n1 and p-body layers. This effectively shorts the base-emitter parasitic 
junction, preventing it from turning on. The result of shorting these two layers is 
the creation of a parasitic body-diode , as shown in Fig. 12-24 b. 
The anti-parallel parasitic body-diode of most power MOSFETs will be 
shown on the component schematic symbol as shown in Fig. 12-25 a. Sometimes, 
this body-diode will be drawn as a zener diode. Because of its large junction area, 
this diode has a long reverse recovery time. This limits the use of the diode to low-
frequency applications, such as in motor control circuits, half-bridge and full-bridge 
convertors. In high-frequency applications, the parasitic diode is often paralleled 
externally by an ultra-fast rectifi  er to prevent it from turning on. If allowed to turn 
on, reverse recovery losses will increase the MOSFET’s power dissipation.
Because a power MOSFET is composed of multiple semiconductor 
 layers, capacitance will exist at each of the pn junctions. Figure 12-25b shows a 
simplifi  ed model for the parasitic capacitances of a power MOSFET. Data books 
will often list the parasitic capacitance of a MOSFET by its input capacitance Figure 12-24   UMOSFET: ( a) Structure; ( b) parasitic elements.

GATEMOSFETs 493Ciss 5 Cgd 1 Cgs, output capacitance Coss 5 Cgd 1 Cds, and reverse transfer ca-
pacitance Crss 5 Cgd. Each of these values are measured by manufacturers under 
short-circuit ac conditions.
 The charging and discharging of these parasitic capacitances have a di-
rect effect on the turn-on and turn-off delay times, as well as the overall frequency 
response of the device. Turn-on delay, td(on), is the time it takes to charge the input 
capacitance of the MOSFET before drain current conduction can start. Likewise, 
turn-off delay, td(off), is the time it takes to discharge the capacitance after the de-
vice is turned off. In high-speed switching circuits, special driver circuits must be 
used to quickly charge and discharge these capacitances.
 Table 12-2 is a sample of commercially available power FETs. Notice 
that VGS(on) is 10 V for all these devices. Because they are physically larger de-
vices, they require higher VGS(on) to ensure operation in the ohmic region. As you 
can see, the power ratings of these devices are substantial, capable of handling 
heavy-duty applications like automotive controls, lighting, and heating.
The analysis of a power FET circuit is the same as for small-signal  devices. 
When driven by a VGS(on) of 10 V, a power FET has a small resistance of RDS(on) in 
the ohmic region. As before, an ID(sat) less than ID(on) when VGS 5 VGS(on) guarantees 
that the device is biased in the ohmic region and acts like a small  resistance.
Lack of Thermal Runaway
Bipolar junction transistors may be destroyed by thermal  runaway.  The problem 
with bipolar transistors is the negative temperature coeffi  cient of VBE. When the

In many cases, bipolar devices 
and MOS devices are used in 
the same electronic circuit. An 
interface circuit connects the 
output of one circuit to the input 
of the next; its function is to 
take the driver output signal and 
condition it so that it is compati-
ble with the requirements of the 
load.Table 12–2 Power FET Sampler

CgsCdsDRAIN494 Chapter 12internal temperature increases, VBE decreases. This increases the collector current, 
forcing the temperature higher. But a higher temperature reduces VBE even more. 
If not properly heat-sinked, the bipolar transistor will go into thermal runaway 
and be destroyed.
 One major advantage of power FETs over bipolar transistors is the lack 
of thermal runaway. The RDS(on) of a MOSFET has a positive temperature coeffi  -
cient. When the internal temperature increases, RDS(on) increases and reduces the 
drain current, which lowers the temperature. As a result, power FETs are inher-
ently temperature-stable and cannot go into thermal runaway.
Power FETs in Parallel
Bipolar junction transistors cannot be connected in parallel because their VBE 
drops do not match closely enough. If you try to connect them in parallel, current 
hogging  occurs. This means that the transistor with the lower VBE takes more col-
lector current than the others.
 Power FETs in parallel do not suffer from the problem of current hog-
ging. If one of the power FETs tries to hog the current, its internal temperature 
will increase. This increases its RDS(on), which reduces its drain current. The over-
all effect is for all the power FETs to have equal drain currents.
Faster Turnoff  
As mentioned earlier, the minority carriers of bipolar transistors are stored in the 
junction area during forward bias. When you try to switch off a bipolar transistor, 
the stored charges fl  ow for a while, preventing a fast turnoff. Since a power FET 
does not have minority carriers, it can switch a large current off faster than a 
 bipolar transistor can. Typically, a power FET can switch off amperes of current in 
tens of nanoseconds. This is 10 to 100 times faster than with a comparable bipolar 
junction transistor.
Power FET as an Interface
Digital ICs are low-power devices because they can supply only small load cur-
rents. If we want to use the output of a digital IC to drive a high-current load, we 
can use a power FET as an interface  (a device B that allows device A to commu-
nicate with or control device C).
 Figure 12-26 shows how a digital IC can control a high-power load. The 
output of the digital IC drives the gate of the power FET. When the digital output 
is high, the power FET is like a closed switch. When the digital output is low, the 
power FET is like an open switch. Interfacing digital ICs (small-signal EMOS and 
CMOS) to high-power loads is one of the important applications of power FETs.
 Figure 12-27 is an example of a digital IC controlling a high-power load. 
When the CMOS output is high, the power FET acts like a closed switch. The 
motor winding then has approximately 12 V across it, and the motor shaft turns. 
When the CMOS output is low, the power FET is open and the motor stops turning.
DC-to-AC Converters
When there is a sudden power failure, computers will stop operating and valuable 
data may be lost. One solution is to use an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).  
A UPS contains a battery and a dc-to-ac converter. The basic idea is this: When 
there is a power failure, the battery voltage is converted to an ac voltage to drive 
the computer.
 Figure 12-28 shows a dc-to-ac converter,  the basic idea behind a UPS. 
When the power fails, other circuits (op amps, discussed later) are activated and 
generate a square wave to drive the gate. The square-wave input switches the Figure 12-26   Power FET is the

windings, the secondary winding can supply the ac voltage needed to keep the

idea of converting dc to ac is the same.
DC-to-DC Converters
Figure 12-29 is a dc-to-dc converter,  a circuit that converts an input dc voltage to 
an output dc voltage that is either higher or lower. The power FET switches on and 
off, producing a square wave across the secondary winding. The half-wave rec-
tifi er and capacitor-input fi  lter then produce the dc output voltage Vout. By using 
different turns ratios, we can get a dc output voltage that is higher or lower than 
the input voltage Vin. For lower ripple, a full-wave or bridge rectifi  er can be used. 
The dc-to-dc converter is one of the important sections of a switching or switch-
mode power supply. This application will be examined in Chapter 22.496 Chapter 12

12-9   High-Side MOSFET Load 
Switches
High-side load switches  are used to connect or disconnect a power source to its 
respective load. Whereas a high-side power switch is used to control the amount 
of output power by limiting its output current, a high-side load switch passes the 
input voltage and current to the load without the current limiting function. High-
side load switches enable battery-powered systems, such as notebook computers, 
cell phones, and hand-held entertainment systems, to make proper power man-
agement decisions by turning on and off system sub-circuits as needed to extend 
battery life.SOLUTION   When the manual switch is closed, the large capacitor C1 charges slowly toward 10 V . As the gate voltage 
 increases above VGS(th), the power FET begins to conduct. Since the gate voltage is changing slowly, the operating point 
of the power FET has to pass slowly through the active region of Fig. 12-33 b. Because of this, the lamp gets gradually 
brighter. When the operating point of the power FET fi  nally reaches the ohmic region, the lamp brightness is maximum. The 
overall effect is a soft turn-on  of the lamp.

What does the circuit of Fig. 12-33 a do? What is the RC time constant? What is the lamp power at full brightness?MOSFETs 499 Figure 12-34 shows the main circuit blocks of a load switch. It consists 
of a pass element, gate control block, and an input logic block. The pass element 
is generally either a p-channel or n-channel power E-MOSFET. The n-channel 
MOSFET is preferred in high current applications due to its higher channel mo-
bility (electrons). This results in a lower RDS(on) value and a smaller gate input 
 capacitance for the same FET die area. The p-channel MOSFET has the advantage 
of using a simple gate control block. The gate control block generates the proper 
gate voltage that enables the pass element to fully turn on and off. The input logic 
block is controlled by a power management circuit, often a microcontroller chip, 
and generates the enable EN signal used to trigger the gate control block.
P-Channel Load Switch
An example of a simple p-channel load switch circuit is shown in Fig. 12-35. The 
p-channel power MOSFET has its source lead connected directly to the input 
voltage rail Vin and the drain connected to the load. To turn on the p-channel load 
switch, the gate voltage must be lower than Vin so the transistor is biased in the 
ohmic region and has a low RDS(on) value. This condition is satisfi  ed when:
VG /H11349 Vin 2 |VGS(on)| (12-7) 
Because VGS(on) for a p-channel MOSFET is a negative value, Eq. (12-7) uses the 
absolute value for VGS(on).
 In Fig. 12-35, an input enable signal EN is generated from the system’s 
power management control circuitry. This signal drives the gate of a small-signal 
n-channel MOSFET. When EN is $ VGS(on), the High-input signal turns on Q1
which pulls the pass transistor’s gate to ground, and the load switch Q2 turns on. Figure 12-34   Load switch circuit blocks.

ENLOAD SWITCH500 Chapter 12If RDS(on) of Q2 is very low, almost all of Vin is passed to the load. Because all of 
the load current fl  ows through the pass transistor, the output voltage is:
Vout 5 Vin 2 (ILoad)(RDS(on)) (12-8)
When EN is Low ( ,VGS(th)), Q1 turns off. The gate of Q2 is pulled up to Vin 
through R1 and the load switch turns off. Vout now is approximately zero volts.
N-channel Load Switch
An n-channel load switch is shown in Fig. 12-36. With this confi  guration, the 
drain of the load switch Q2 is connected to the input voltage Vin and the source 
lead is connected to the load. As with the p-channel load switch, Q1 is used to fully 
turn on or off the pass element Q2. Again, a logic signal from the system power 
management circuitry is used to trigger the gate control block.
 So what is the purpose of the separate VGate voltage source? When the 
load switch turns on, almost all of Vin is passed to the load. Since the source lead 
is connected to the load, VS is now equal to Vin. In order to keep the load switch Q2 
fully turned on with a low RDS(on) value, VG must be greater than Vout by a voltage 
greater than or equal to its VGS(on) value. Therefore:
VG /H11350 Vout /H11001 VGS(on) (12-9)
The extra voltage rail VGate is needed to level-shift  VG above the level of Vout. In 
some systems, the additional voltage rail is developed from either the Vin source 
or from the EN signal by using a special circuit called a charge pump . The added 
expense of the extra voltage rail is offset by the circuit’s ability to pass low-input 
voltages, close to zero volts, and lower VDS losses.
 In Fig. 12-36, when the EN input signal is Low, Q1 is turned off. The gate 
of Q2 is pulled up to the level of the VGate rail. Q2 turns on passing almost all of Vin 
to the load. Since the gate of Q2 meets the requirement of VG $ Vout 1 VGS(on), Q2 
remains fully on.
 When the EN input signal goes High, Q1 turns on causing its drain lead 
to be at approximately zero volts. This turns off Q2 and the output voltage across 
the load is zero volts.
Other Considerations
To extend the battery life of portable systems, the effi  ciency of the load switch 
becomes crucial. Since all of the load current fl  ows through the MOSFET pass 
element, it becomes the main source of power loss. This can be shown by:
PLoss /H11005 (ILoad)2(RDS(on)) (12-10)Figure 12-36 N channel load switch.

VGateMOSFETs 501For a given semiconductor die area, an n-channel MOSFET’s RDS(on) value can be 
2 to 3 times lower than a p-channel MOSFET. Therefore, using Eq. (12-10), its 
power losses are smaller. This is especially true at high load currents. The p-chan-
nel device has the advantage of not requiring the additional voltage rail required 
to keep the pass transistor on when it conducts. This becomes important when 
passing a high level of input voltage.
 The speed at which the load switch is turned on and off becomes another 
consideration, especially when connected to a capacitive load CL, as shown in 
Fig. 12-37. Before the load switch turns on, the voltage across the load is zero 
volts. When the load switch passes the input voltage to the capacitive load, a 
surge of current charges up CL. This high current level is referred to as inrush 
current  and has some potential negative effects. First, the high surge current must 
fl ow through the pass transistor and could damage the load switch or shorten its 
lifetime. Second, this inrush current can cause a negative spike or dip in the input 
supply voltage. This could cause problems to other sub-system circuits that are 
connected to the same Vin source.
 In Fig. 12-37, R2 and C1 are used to create a “ soft-start ” function to de-
crease these effects. The additional components allow the gate voltage on the pass 
transistor to ramp up at a controlled rate which reduces the inrush current. Also, 
when the load switch abruptly turns off, the charge on the capacitive load does not 
instantly discharge. This can cause incomplete load shut off. To overcome this, the 
gate control block can provide a signal used to turn on an active-load discharge 
transistor Q3, as shown in Fig. 12-37. This transistor will discharge the capacitive 
load when the pass transistor is turned off. Q1 is contained in the control block.
 The majority of high-side load switch components can be integrated into 
small-sized surface-mount packages. This greatly reduces the footprint required 
on a circuit board.Figure 12-37   Load switch with capacitive load.

In Fig. 12-38, what is the output load voltage, output load power, and MOSFET 
pass transistor power loss when the EN signal is 3.5 V and when it is 0 V? Use an 
RDS(on) value of 50 mΩ for Q2.502 Chapter 1212-10  MOSFET H-Bridge
A simplifi  ed H-bridge circuit is composed of four electronic (or mechanical) 
switches. Two switches are connected on each side with the load placed between 
the center junctions of both sides. As shown in Fig. 12-39( a), this confi  guration 
forms the letter “H,” thus its name. Sometimes this confi  guration is called a full-
bridge, as compared to applications where only one side of the bridge is used and 
is called a half-bridge. S1 and S3 are referred to as  high-side switches  while S2 and 
S4 are the low-side switches.  By controlling the individual “switches,” the current 
through the load can be made to vary in both direction and intensity.
SOLUTION   When the EN signal is 13.5 V , Q1 will turn on. This pulls the 
gate of Q2 to ground. Now, VGS for Q2 will be approximately 25 V . The pass tran-
sistor turns on with an RDS(on) value of 50 m V.

When the EN signal is 0 V , Q1 will turn off. This places 5 V on the gate of Q2 turn-
ing the pass transistor off. The output load voltage, output load power, and pass 
transistor power loss are all zero.

0 V10 k ΩMOSFETs 503 In Fig. 12-39( b), switches S1 and S4 are closed. This will cause a current 
to fl  ow through the resistive load from left to right. By opening S1 and S4, along 
with closing S2 and S3, current will fl  ow through the load in the opposite direc-
tion, as shown in Fig 12-39( c). The intensity of load current can be changed by 
adjusting the level of applied voltage 1V or, preferably, by controlling the on/off 
time of the various switches. If a pair of switches were closed (on) half of the time 
and open (off) half of the time, this would produce a 50% duty cycle resulting in 
the load having half of the normal full current level. Controlling the on/off times 
effectively controls the duty cycle of the switches and is referred to as pulse width 
modulation (PWM) control. Care must be taken not to have simultaneous closure 
of both switches on one side of the bridge. As an example, if S1 and S2 were both 
closed, this would result in a high current fl  ow through the switches from 1V to 
ground. This shoot-through  current could either damage the switches or damage 
the power source.
 In Fig. 12-40, the load resistor has been replaced by a DC motor and 
each side uses a common +V source. The direction and speed of the motor 
is controlled by the switches. Table 12-3 displays some of the useful switch Figure 12-39   (a) “H” conﬁ  guration; ( b) left-to-right current; ( c) right-to-left current.

switches are open, the motor will be off. If this condition occurred when the 
motor was already running, the motor would coast to a stop or be free-wheeling . 
Proper closure of each high-side and low-side pair of switches results in a direc-
tion change of the motor. Closing S1 and S4, with S2 and S3 open, produces a for-
ward direction of the motor. Closing S2 and S3, with S1 and S4 open, results in a 
reverse direction of the motor. When the motor is running, either both high-side 
or low-side pair of switches can be closed. Because the motor is still rotating, 
the self-generating voltage of the motor effectively acts as a dynamic brake to 
quickly stop the motor.
Discrete H-Bridge
As shown in Fig. 12-41, the simple switches of an H-bridge have been replaced 
with discrete n-channel and p-channel power E-MOSFETs. Although BJTs can 
be used, power E-MOSFETs have less complicated input control, faster switching 
speeds, and more closely resemble an ideal switch. The two high-side switches 
Q1 and Q3 are p-channel MOSFETs while the low-side switches Q2 and Q4 are 
n-channel MOSFETs. Because the high-side switches have their source leads con-
nected to the positive supply voltage, each p-channel device is placed in a proper 
conducting mode when their gate drive voltage VG is lower than VS satisfying 
the 2VGS(on) requirement. The high-side MOSFETs can be turned off when their 
gate voltage is made equal to their source voltage. The two low-side switches Q2 
and Q4 are n-channel MOSFETs. Their drain leads are connected to the load and 
source leads connected to ground. They are turned on when the 1VGS(on) require-
ment is applied.
 In high-power applications, the high-side p-channel MOSFETs are 
often replaced with n-channel MOSFETs as shown in Fig. 12-42. The n-channel 
MOSFETs have a lower RDS(on) value which results in lower power losses. The 
n-channel MOSFETs also have faster switching speeds. This becomes especially 
important when using high-speed PWM control. When n-channel MOSFETs are 
used as high-side switches, they need additional circuits to provide a gate drive Figure 12-41   Discrete p-channel high-side switches.

Q2 Q4DCMOSFETs 505voltage higher than the positive supply voltage connected to their drain leads. This 
requires a charge pump or boot-strapped voltage to fully turn on.
 Although using a discrete MOSFET H-bridge appears to be a simple 
solution, its implementation is not simple. Many problems do exist that must be 
accounted for. Because MOSFETs have gate input capacitance Ciss, there will 
be a delay time for turning the power FET on and turning it off. The gate drive 
circuits must be able to interpret the input logic control signals and provide suf-
fi cient gate drive current to quickly charge up or discharge the MOSFET’s input 
capacitance. When changing the direction of the motor or performing dynamic 
braking, timing is important to allow the required MOSFETs to fully turn off 
before the other MOSFETs are turned on. Otherwise, shoot-through currents 
will damage the MOSFETs. Other consideration, such as output short-circuit 
protection, 1V supply variations, and overheating of the power MOSFETs must 
be considered.
Monolithic H-bridge
A monolithic H-bridge is a special integrated circuit which combines the inter-
nal control logic, gate drive, charge pump, and power MOSFETs all on one sil-
icon substrate. Figure 12-43( a) shows the surface-mount power package for an 
MC33886 integrated 5.0 A H-bridge. Because all of the required internal compo-
nents are fabricated in the same package, it is much easier to provide the needed 
gate drive circuits, properly match the output drivers, and build in the essential 
protection circuits. 
 A simplifi  ed diagram of the MC33886 is shown in Fig. 12-43( b). The 
monolithic H-bridge requires only a few external components to properly operate 
and uses a low number of input control lines. The H-bridge receives four input 
logic control signals from a microcontroller unit (MCU). IN1 and IN2 control the Figure 12-42   Discrete n-channel high-side switches.

(b) (a)MOSFETs 507are used to keep the high-current power ground PGND from interfering with the 
low-current analog signal ground AGND. The H-bridge output drive circuit uses 
four n-channel power E-MOSFETs. Q1 and Q2 form one half-bridge while Q3 and 
Q4 form the other half. Each half-bridge can be independent from the other or 
used together when a full-bridge is required. Because the high-side switches are 
n-channel MOSFETs, a built-in charge pump is necessary to provide the proper 
high level gate voltage needed to keep the transistors fully on when conducting.
 A partial logic truth table for the MC33886 is shown in Table 12-4. Input 
control lines IN1, IN2, D1, and D2   are used to control the direction and speed 
of an attached DC motor. These inputs are TTL (stands for transistor-transistor 
logic , a family of digital circuits) and CMOS compatible, which allows input 
control from either digital logic circuits or the output of an MCU. IN1 and IN2 
independently control OUT1 and OUT2, respectively, by providing the control 
of the two totem-pole half-bridge outputs. When D1 is a logic High or D2   is a 
logic Low, both H-bridge outputs are disabled and set to a high-impedance state, 
regardless of the inputs IN1 and IN2.
 As shown in Table 12-4, when IN1 is a logic High and IN2 is a logic 
Low, the gate drive circuitry turns on Q1 and Q4 while turning off Q2 and Q3. 
Therefore, OUT1 will be High, set to V 1, and OUT2 will be Low, approximately 
0 V . This will cause the DC motor to rotate in one direction. The outputs are just 
the opposite when IN1 is Low and IN2 is High. This input condition turns on Q2
and Q3 while Q1 and Q4 are turned off. Now, OUT2 is High and OUT1 is Low Table 12-4Logic Truth Table. “Copyright 2014 Freescale

High-impedance (all output power transistors are switched off).508 Chapter 12which causes the DC motor to rotate in the opposite direction. When the control 
signals to both IN1 and IN2 are a logic High, the output status of OUT1 and 
OUT2 will each be High. Likewise, when both inputs are Low, both outputs are 
Low. Each of these input conditions will cause either both high-side switches or 
low-side switches to be on, allowing the DC motor to dynamically brake.
 The speed of the DC motor connected to OUT1 and OUT2 can be con-
trolled by using pulse width modulation. An external source or output signal from 
the MCU is connected to IN1 or IN2 and applies a PWM pulse train that can vary 
its duty cycle. The other input is held at a logic High. By changing the duty cycle 
of the input pulse train, the motor’s speed will change. The higher the duty cycle, 
the higher the motor speed. By changing which input receives the pulse train, the 
motor speed can be controlled in the reverse direction. Because of the switching 
speed of the output MOSFETs and limits of the circuit’s charge pump, the maxi-
mum frequency of the PWM signal for the MC33886 is 10 kHz. 
 As shown in Table 12-4, if inputs D1 and D2 are not High and Low, 
respectively, both outputs will go into a high-impedance state. This effectively 
disables the outputs. The output disabled state will also occur if the MC33886 
senses an over-temperature, under-voltage, current limit, or short-circuit condi-
tion. When any of these events happen, a Low-level fault status signal is generated 
which is sent to the MCU.
 As compared to discrete H-bridge circuits, monolithic H-bridges, such 
as the MC33886, are relatively easy to implement. Applications using fractional 
horsepower DC motors and solenoids can be found in a variety of systems includ-
ing the automotive, industrial, and robotic industries. 
12-11  E-MOSFET Ampliﬁ  ers
As mentioned in previous sections, the E-MOSFET fi  nds its use primarily as 
a switch. Applications do exist for this device to be used as an amplifi  er, how-
ever. These applications include front-end high-frequency RF amplifi  ers used in 
 communications equipment and power E-MOSFETs used in Class-AB power 
 amplifi  ers.
 With E-MOSFETs, VGS has to be greater than VGS(th) for drain current to 
fl ow. This eliminates self-bias, current-source bias, and zero bias because all these 
will have depletion-mode operation. This leaves gate bias and voltage-divider 
bias. Both of these biasing arrangements will work with E-MOSFETs because 
they can achieve enhancement-mode operation.

ductance formula will not work with the E-MOSFET. The drain current can be 
found by:

 The data sheet for a 2N7000 n-channel enhancement-mode FET is 
shown in Fig. 12-12. Again, the important values needed are ID(on), VGS(on), and 
VGS(th). The specifi  cations for the 2N7000 show a large variance in values. Typical 
values will be used in the following calculations. ID(on) is shown to be 600 mA 
when VGS 5 4.5 V . Therefore, use 4.5 V for the VGS(on) values. Also shown, VGS(th)
has a typical value of 2.1 V when VDS 5 VGS and ID 5 1 mA.
 Figure 12-46 a shows another biasing method for E-MOSFETs called 
drain-feedback bias.  This biasing method is similar to collector-feedback bias 
used with bipolar junction transistors. When the MOSFET is conducting, it has a 
drain current of ID(on) and a drain voltage of VDS(on). Because there is virtually no 
gate current, VGS 5 VDS(on). As with collector-feedback, drain-feedback bias tends 510 Chapter 12to compensate for changes in FET characteristics. For example, if ID(on) tries to 
increase for some reason, VDS(on) decreases. This reduces VGS and partially offsets 
the original increase in ID(on).
 Figure 12-46 b shows the Q point on the transconductance curve. The Q
point has the coordinates of ID(on) and VDS(con). Data sheets for E-MOSFETs often 
give a value of ID(on) for VGS 5 VDS(on). When designing this circuit, select a value

12-12  MOSFET Testing
MOSFET devices require special care when being tested for proper operation. As 
stated previously, the thin layer of silicon dioxide between the gate and channel 
can be easily destroyed when VGS exceeds VGS(max). Because of the insulated gate, 
along with the channel construction, testing MOSFET devices with an ohmmeter 
or DMM is not very effective. A good way to test these devices is with a semicon-
ductor curve tracer. If a curve tracer is not available, special test circuits can be 
constructed. Figure 12-48 a shows a circuit capable of testing both depletion-mode 
and enhancement-mode MOSFETs. By changing the voltage level and  polarity of

Summary
SEC. 12-1   THE  DEPLETION-
MODE MOSFET
The depletion-mode MOSFET, ab-
breviated D-MOSFET , has a source, 
gate, and drain. The gate is insulated 
from the channel. Because of this, 
the input resistance is very high. The 
D-MOSFET has limited use, mainly in 
RF circuits.
SEC. 12-2  D-MOSFET CURVES
The drain curves for a D-MOSFET 
are similar to those of a JFET when 
the MOS device is operating in 
the depletion mode. Unlike JFETs, 
D-MOSFETs can also operate in the 
enhancement mode. When operating 
in the enhancement mode, the drain 
current is greater than IDSS.
SEC. 12-3   DEPLETION-MODE 
MOSFET AMPLIFIERS
D-MOSFETs are mainly used as RF 
ampliﬁ  ers. D-MOSFETs have good 
high-frequency response, generate 
low levels of electrical noise, and 
maintain high-input impedance val-
ues when VGS is negative or positive. 
Dual-gate D-MOSFETs can be used 
with automatic gain control (AGC) 
circuits.
SEC. 12-4   THE ENHANCEMENT-
MODE MOSFET
The E-MOSFET is normally off  . 
When the gate voltage equals the 
threshold voltage, an n-type inver-
sion layer connects the source to the 
drain. When the gate voltage is much greater than the threshold voltage, 
the device conducts heavily. Because 
of the thin insulating layer, MOSFETs 
are easily destroyed unless you take 
precautions in handling them.
SEC. 12-5  THE OHMIC REGION
Since the E-MOSFET is primarily a 
switching device, it usually operates 
between cutoff   and saturation. When 
it is biased in the ohmic region, it acts 
like a small resistance. If ID(sat) is less 
than ID(on) when VGS 5 VGS(on), the 
E-MOSFET is operating in the ohmic 
region.
SEC. 12-6  DIGITAL SWITCHING
Analog  means that the signal 
changes continuously, that is, with 
no sudden jumps. Digital  means 
that the signal jumps between two 
distinct voltage levels. Switching 
includes high-power circuits as well 
as small-signal digital circuits. Ac-
tive-load switching means that one of 
the MOSFETs acts like a large resist-
ance and the other like a switch.
SEC. 12-7  CMOS
CMOS uses two complementary 
MOSFETs, in which one conducts 
and the other shuts off  . The CMOS 
inverter is a basic digital circuit. 
CMOS devices have the advantage 
of very low-power consumption.
SEC. 12-8  POWER FETS
Discrete E-MOSFETs can be man-
ufactured to switch very large cur-
rents. Known as power FETS,  these devices are useful in automotive con-
trols, disk drives, converters, printers, 
heating, lighting, motors, and other 
heavy-duty applications.
SEC 12-9  HIGH-SIDE MOSFET 
LOAD SWITCHES
High-side MOSFET load switches 
are used to connect or disconnect a 
power source to its load.
SEC 12-10  MOSFET H-BRIDGE
Discrete and monolithic H-bridges 
can be used to control the current 
direction and level of current through 
a given load. DC motor control is a 
common application.
SEC. 12-11   E-MOSFET 
AMPLIFIERS
Besides their main use as power 
switches, E-MOSFETs ﬁ  nd applica-
tions as ampliﬁ  ers. The normally off   
characteristics of E-MOSFETs dictate 
that VGS be greater than VGS(th) when 
used as an ampliﬁ  er. Drain-feedback 
bias is similar to collector-feedback 
bias.
SEC. 12-12  MOSFET TESTING
It is diffi   cult to safely test MOSFET 
devices using an ohmmeter. If a sem-
iconductor curve tracer is not avail-
able, MOSFETs can be tested in test 
circuits or by simple substitution.

The word thyristor  comes from the Greek and means “door,” 
as in opening a door and letting something pass through it. A 
thyristor is a semiconductor device that uses internal feedback 
to produce switching action. The most important thyristors are 
the silicon controlled rectiﬁ  er (SCR) and the triac. Like power 
FETs, the SCR and the triac can switch large currents on and off  . 
Because of this, they can be used for overvoltage protection, 
motor controls, heaters, lighting systems, and other heavy-
current loads. Insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) are not 
included in the thyristor family, but are covered in this chapter as 
an important power-switching device.

13-8  Troubleshooting526 Chapter 1313-1 The Four-Layer Diode
Thyristor operation can be explained in terms of the equivalent circuit shown in 
Fig. 13-1 a. The upper transistor Q1 is a pnp device, and the lower transistor Q2 is 
an npn device. The collector of Q1 drives the base of Q2. Similarly, the collector 
of Q2 drives the base of  Q1.
Positive Feedback
The unusual connection of Fig. 13-1 a uses positive feedback.  Any change in the 
base current of Q2 is amplifi  ed and fed back through Q1 to magnify the original 
change. This positive feedback continues changing the base current of Q2 until 
both transistors go into either saturation or cutoff.
For instance, if the base current of Q2 increases, the collector current 
of Q2 increases. This increases the base current of Q1 and the collector current 
of Q1. More collector current in Q1 will further increase the base current of Q2. 
This  amplify-and-feedback action continues until both transistors are driven into 
saturation. In this case, the overall circuit acts like a closed switch (Fig. 13-1 b).
On the other hand, if something causes the base current of Q2 to  decrease, 
the collector current of Q2 decreases, the base current of Q1 decreases, the col-
lector current of Q1 decreases, and the base current of Q2 decreases further. This 
action continues until both transistors are driven into cutoff. Then, the circuit acts 
like an open switch (Fig. 13-1 c).
The circuit of Fig. 13-1 a is stable in either of two states: open  or closed.  
It will remain in either state indefi  nitely until acted on by an outside force. If the 
circuit is open, it stays open until something increases the base current of Q2. If 
the circuit is closed, it stays closed until something decreases the base current of 
Q2. Because the circuit can remain in either state indefi  nitely, it is called a latch.
Closing a Latch
Figure 13-2 a shows a latch connected to a load resistor with a supply voltage 
of VCC. Assume that the latch is open, as shown in Fig. 13-2 b. Because there is 
no current through the load resistor, the voltage across the latch equals the supply 
voltage. So, the operating point is at the lower end of the dc load line (Fig. 13-2 d).
The only way to close the latch of Fig. 13-2 b is by breakover.  This means 
using a large enough supply voltage VCC to break down the Q1 collector diode. Figure 13-1  Transistor latch.

Q2Q1Thyristors 527Since the collector current of Q1 increases the base current of Q2, the  positive 
feedback will start. This drives both transistors into saturation, as previously 
described. When saturated, both transistors ideally look like short-circuits, 
and the latch is closed (Fig. 13-2 c). Ideally, the latch has zero voltage across 
it when it is closed and the operating point is at the upper end of the load line 
(Fig. 13-2 d).
In Fig. 13-2 a, breakover can also occur if Q2 breaks down fi  rst. Although 
breakover starts with the breakdown of either collector diode, it ends with both 
transistors in the saturated state. This is why the term breakover  is used instead of 
breakdown  to describe this kind of latch closing.
Opening a Latch
How do we open the latch of Fig. 13-2 a? By reducing the VCC supply to zero. 
This forces the transistors to switch from saturation to cutoff. We call this type of 
opening low-current drop-out  because it depends on reducing the latch current 
to a value low enough to bring the transistors out of saturation.
The Schockley Diode
Figure 13-3 a was originally called a Schockley diode  after the inventor. Several 
other names are also used for this device: four-layer diode,  pnpn diode,  and sili-
con unilateral switch (SUS).  The device lets current fl  ow in only one direction.
The easiest way to understand how it works is to visualize it separated 
into two halves, as shown in Fig. 13-3 b. The left half is a pnp transistor,  and the 
right half is an npn transistor.  Therefore, the four-layer diode is equivalent to the 
latch of Fig. 13-3 c.
Figure 13-3 d shows the schematic symbol of a four-layer diode. The 
only way to close a four-layer diode is by breakover. The only way to open it is by 
low-current drop-out, which means reducing the current to less than the holding 
current  (given on data sheets). The holding current is the low value of current 
where the transistors switch from saturation to cutoff.
After a four-layer diode breaks over, the voltage across it ideally drops to 
zero. In reality, there is some voltage across the latched diode. Figure 13-3 e shows 
current versus voltage for a 1N5158 that is latched on. As you can see, the voltage 
across the device increases when the current increases: 1 V at 0.2 A, 1.5 V at 0.95 
A, 2 V at 1.8 A, and so on.GOOD TO KNOW
The four-layer diode is rarely, 
if ever, used in modern circuit 
design. In fact, most device 
manufacturers no longer make 
them. In spite of the fact that the 
device is nearly obsolete, it is 
covered in detail here because 
most of the operating principles 
of the four-layer diode can be 
applied to many of the more 
commonly used thyristors. In 
fact, most thyristors are nothing 
more than slight variations of the 
basic four-layer diode.

Figure 13-4 shows the graph of current versus voltage of a four-layer diode. The 
device has two operating regions: cutoff and saturation. The dashed line is the 
transition path between cutoff and saturation. It is dashed to indicate that the 
 device switches rapidly between the off and on states.
When the device is at cutoff, it has zero current. If the voltage across 
diode tries to exceed VB, the device breaks over and moves rapidly along the 
dashed line to the saturation region. When the diode is in saturation, it is operat-
ing on the upper line. As long as the current through it is greater than the holding 
current IH, the diode remains latched in the on state. If the current becomes less 
than IH, the device switches into cutoff.
The ideal approximation of a four-layer diode is an open switch when cut 
off and a closed switch when saturated. The second approximation includes the 
knee voltage VK, approximately 0.7 V in Fig. 13-4. For higher approximations, 
use computer simulation software or refer to the data sheet of the four-layer diode.Figure 13-4  Breakover characteristic.
The diode of Fig. 13-5 has a breakover voltage of 10 V. If the input voltage of 
Fig. 13-5 is increased to 115 V, what is the diode current?
SOLUTION  Since an input voltage of 15 V is more than the break over v oltage 
of 10 V , the diode breaks over. Ideally, the diode is like a closed switch, so the 
current is:
I 5   15 V ______ 100 V   5 150 mA
To a second approximation:
I 5   15 V 2 0.7 V  ____________  100 V   5 143 mA
For a more accurate answer, look at Fig. 13-3 e and you will see that the voltage 
is 0.9 V when the current is around 150 mA. Therefore, an improved answer is:
I 5   15 V 2 0.9 V  ____________  100 V   5 141 mA

Example 13-2
The diode of Fig. 13-5 has a holding current of 4 mA. The input voltage is increased to 15 V to latch the diode and then 
decreased to open the diode. What is the input voltage that opens the diode?
SOLUTION  The diode opens when the current is slightly less than the holding current, given as 4 mA. At this small cur-
rent, the diode voltage is approximately equal to the knee voltage, 0.7 V . Since 4 mA fl  ows through 100 V, the input voltage is:
Vin 5 0.7 V 1 (4 mA)(100 V) 5 1.1 V
So, the input voltage has to be reduced from 15 V to slightly less than 1.1 V to open the diode.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 13-2   Repeat Example 13-2 using a diode with a holding current of 10 mA.
Application Example 13-3
Figure 13-6 a shows a sawtooth generator.  The capacitor charges toward the supply voltage, as shown in Fig. 13-6 b. When 
the capacitor voltage reaches 110 V, the diode breaks over. This discharges the capacitor, producing the fl  yback  (sudden 
voltage drop) of the output waveform. When the voltage is ideally zero, the diode opens and the capacitor begins to charge 
again. In this way, we get the ideal sawtooth shown in Fig. 13-6 b.
What is the RC time constant for capacitor charging? What is the frequency of the sawtooth wave if its period is 
approximately 20 percent of the time constant?
SOLUTION   The RC time constant is:
RC 5 (2 kV)(0.02 /H9262F) 5 40 /H9262s
The period is approximately 20 percent of the time constant. The fi  rst 20 percent of one time constant is basically linear.  
Therefore:

The SCR  is the most widely used thyristor. It can switch very large currents on 
and off. Because of this, it is used to control motors, ovens, air conditioners, and 
induction heaters.
Triggering the Latch
By adding an input terminal to the base of Q2, as shown in Fig. 13-7 a, we can create a 
second way to close the latch. Here is the theory of operation: When the latch is open, 
as shown in Fig. 13-7 b, the operating point is at the lower end of the dc load line 
(Fig. 13-7 d). To close the latch, we can couple a trigger  (sharp pulse) into the base 
of Q2, as shown in Fig. 13-7 a. The trigger momentarily increases the base current of 
Q2. This starts the positive feedback, which drives both transistors into saturation.
When saturated, both transistors ideally look like short-circuits, and the 
latch is closed (Fig. 13-7 c). Ideally, the latch has zero voltage across it when it is 
closed, and the operating point is at the upper end of the load line (Fig. 13-7 d).
Gate Triggering
Figure 13-8 a shows the structure of the SCR. The input is called the gate,  the top 
is the anode,  and the bottom is the cathode.  The SCR is far more useful than a 
four-layer diode because the gate triggering is easier than breakover triggering.
Figure 13-7  Transistor latch with trigger input.GOOD TO KNOW
SCRs are designed to handle 
higher values of current and 
voltage than any other type of 
thyristor. Presently, some SCRs 
are capable of controlling large 
currents up to 1.5  kA and volt-
ages in excess of 2  kV.

(d) (c) (b) (a)Thyristors 531Again, we can visualize the four doped regions separated into two tran-
sistors, as shown in Fig. 13-8 b. Therefore, the SCR is equivalent to a latch with 
a trigger input (Fig. 13-8 c). Schematic diagrams use the symbol of Fig. 13-8 d. 
Whenever you see this symbol, remember that it is equivalent to a latch with a 
trigger input. Typical SCRs are shown in Fig. 13-9.
Since the gate of an SCR is connected to the base of an internal transis-
tor, it takes at least 0.7 V to trigger an SCR. Data sheets list this voltage as the 
gate trigger voltage VGT. Rather than specify the input resistance of the gate, a 
manufacturer gives the minimum input current needed to turn on the SCR. Data 
sheets list this current as the gate trigger current IGT.
 Figure 13-10 shows a data sheet for the 2N6504 series of SCRs. For this 
 series, it shows typical trigger voltage and current values of:
VGT 5 1.0 V
 IGT 5 9.0 mA
This means that the source driving the gate of a typical 2N6504 series SCR has to 
supply 9.0 mA at 1.0 V to latch the SCR.
 Also, the breakover voltage or blocking voltage is specifi  ed as its peak 
repetitive off-state forward voltage VDRM and its peak repetitive off-state reverse 
voltage VRRM. Depending on which SCR of the series is used, the breakover volt-
age ranges from 50 to 800 V .
Required Input Voltage
An SCR like the one shown in Fig. 13-11 has a gate voltage VG. When this volt-
age is more than VGT, the SCR will turn on and the output voltage will drop from 
1VCC to a low value. Sometimes, a gate resistor is used as shown here. This 
 resistor limits the gate current to a safe value. The input voltage needed to trigger 
an SCR has to be more than:
Vin 5 VGT 1 IGTRG (13-1)
In this equation, VGT and IGT are the gate trigger voltage and current for 
the device. For instance, the data sheet of a 2N4441 gives VGT 5 0.75 V and IGT 5
10 mA. When you have the value of RG, the calculation of Vin is straightforward. 
If a gate resistor is not used, RG is the Thevenin resistance of the circuit driving 
the gate. Unless Eq. (13-1) is satisfi  ed, the SCR cannot turn on.
Resetting the SCR
After the SCR has turned on, it stays on even though you reduce the gate supply 
Vin to zero. In this case, the output remains low indefi  nitely. To reset the SCR, 
you must reduce the anode to cathode current to a value less than its holding 
current IH. This can be done by reducing VCC to a low value. The data sheet for Figure 13-9  Typical SCRs.
532 Chapter 13Figure 13-10  SCR data sheet (Used with permission from SCILLC dba ON Semiconductor).
Thyristors 533Figure 13-10  (continued)
534 Chapter 13the 2N6504 lists a typical holding current value of 18 mA. SCRs with lower and 
higher power ratings generally have lower and higher respective holding current 
values. Since the holding current fl  ows through the load resistor in Fig. 13-11, the 
supply voltage for turn-off has to be less than:
VCC 5 0.7 V 1 IHRL (13-2)
 Besides reducing VCC, other methods can be used to reset the SCR. Two 
common methods are current interruption and forced commutation. By either 
opening the series switch, as shown in Fig. 13-12 a, or closing the parallel switch 
in Fig. 13-12 b, the anode-to-cathode current will drop down below its holding 
current value and the SCR will switch to its off state.
 Another method used to reset the SCR is forced commutation, as shown 
in Fig. 13-12 c. When the switch is depressed, a negative VAK voltage is momen-
tarily applied. This reduces the forward anode-to-cathode current below IH and 
turns off the SCR. In actual circuits, the switch can be replaced with a BJT or FET 
device.Figure 13-11  Basic SCR circuit.

–+Thyristors 535Power FET versus SCR
Although both the power FET and the SCR can switch large currents on and off, 
the two devices are fundamentally different. The key difference is the way they 
turn off. The gate voltage of a power FET can turn the device on and off. This is 
not the case with an SCR. The gate voltage can only turn it on.
Figure 13-13 illustrates the difference. In Fig. 13-13 a, when the input 
voltage to the power FET goes high, the output voltage goes low. When the 
input voltage goes low, the output voltage goes high. In other words, a rectan-
gular input pulse produces an inverted rectangular output pulse.
In Fig. 13-13 b, when the input voltage to the SCR goes high, the output 
voltage goes low. But when the input voltage goes low, the output voltage stays 
low. With an SCR, a rectangular input pulse produces a negative-going output 
step. The SCR does not reset.
Because the two devices have to be reset in different ways, their ap-
plications tend to be different. Power FETs respond like push-button switches, 
whereas SCRs respond like single-pole single-throw switches. Since it is easier 
to control the power FET, you will see it used more often as an interface between 
digital ICs and heavy loads. In applications in which latching is important, you 
will see the SCR used.Figure 13-13  Power FET versus SCR.

In Fig. 13-14, the SCR has a trigger voltage of 0.75 V and a trigger current 
of 7 mA. What is the input voltage that turns the SCR on? If the holding current 
is 6 mA, what is the supply voltage that turns it off?
SOLUTION  With Eq. (13-1), the minimum input voltage needed to trigger 
the SCR is:

–+Thyristors 537Testing SCRs
Thyristors, like SCRs, handle large amounts of current and must block high- 
voltage values. Because of this, they may fail under these conditions. Common 
failures are A-K opens, A-K shorts, and no gate control. Figure 13-16 a shows a 
circuit that can test the operation of SCRs. Before S1 is pushed, IAK should be zero 
and VAK should be approximately equal to VA. When S1 is momentarily pushed, 
IAK should rise to a level near VA/RL and VAK should drop to approximately 1 V . 
VA and RL must be selected to provide the necessary current and power levels. 
When S1 is released, the SCR should remain in the on state. The anode supply 
voltage VA can then be reduced until the SCR drops out of conduction. By observ-
ing the anode current value just before the SCR turns off, you can determine the 
SCR’s holding current.
Another method to test SCRs is by using an ohmmeter. The ohmmeter 
must be able to provide the necessary gate voltage and current to turn on the SCR 
and, just as important, provide the holding current required to keep the SCR in 
the on state. Many analog VOMs are capable of outputting approximately 1.5 V 
and 100 mA in the R 3 1 range. In Fig. 13-16 b, the ohmmeter is placed across the 
anode-cathode leads. With either polarity connection, the result should be a very 
high resistance. With the positive test lead connected to the anode and negative 
test lead connected to the cathode, connect a jumper wire from the anode to the 
gate. The SCR should turn on and show a low resistance reading. When the gate 
lead is disconnected, the SCR should remain in the on state. Momentarily discon-
necting the anode test lead will turn the SCR off.
SOLUTION   As the capacitor voltage increases, the SCR eventually fi r e s 
(turns on) and rapidly discharges the capacitor. When the SCR opens, the  capacitor 
begins charging again. Therefore, the output voltage is a sawtooth wave similar to 
the one in Fig. 13-6 b, discussed in Application Example 13-3.
Figure 13-15 b shows the Thevenin circuit facing the gate. The Thevenin 
resistance is:
RTH 5 900 V i 100 V 5 90 V
Using Eq. (13-1), the input voltage needed to trigger the SCR is:
Vin 5 1 V 1 (200 /H9262A)(90 V) < 1 V
Because of the 10 ;1 voltage divider, the gate voltage is one-tenth of the output 
voltage. Therefore, the output voltage at the SCR fi  ring point is:
Vpeak 5 10(1 V) 5 10 V
Figure 13-15 c shows the Thevenin circuit facing the capacitor when the 
SCR is off. From this, you can see that the capacitor will try charging to a fi  nal 
voltage of 150 V with a time constant of:
RC 5 (500 V)(0.2 /H9262F) 5 100 /H9262s
Since the period of the sawtooth is approximately 20 percent of this:
T 5 0.2(100 /H9262s) 5 20 /H9262s
The frequency is:
f 5   1 _____ 20 /H9262s   5 50 kHz538 Chapter 1313-3  The SCR Crowbar
If anything happens inside a power supply to cause its output voltage to go ex-
cessively high, the results can be devastating. Why? Because some loads such as 
 expensive digital ICs cannot withstand too much supply voltage without being 
 destroyed. One of the most important applications of the SCR is to protect delicate 
and expensive loads against overvoltages from a power supply.
Prototype
Figure 13-17 shows a power supply of VCC applied to a protected load. Under nor-
mal conditions, VCC is less than the breakdown voltage of the zener diode. In this 
case, there is no voltage across R, and the SCR remains open. The load  receives a 
voltage of VCC, and all is well.
Now, assume that the supply voltage increases for any reason what-
soever. When VCC is too large, the zener diode breaks down and a voltage ap-
pears across R. If this voltage is greater than the gate trigger voltage of the SCR, 
the SCR fi  res and becomes a closed latch. The action is similar to throwing a Figure 13-16  Testing SCRs: ( a) Test circuit; ( b) ohmmeter.

a 2N4441), the load is quickly protected against the damaging effects of a large 
overvoltage. The overvoltage that fi  res the SCR is:
VCC 5 VZ 1 VGT (13-3)
Crowbarring, though a drastic form of protection, is necessary with 
many digital ICs because they can’t take much overvoltage. Rather than destroy 
expensive ICs, therefore, we can use an SCR crowbar to short the load terminals 
at the fi  rst sign of overvoltage. With an SCR crowbar, a fuse or current-limiting 
circuit  (discussed later) is needed to prevent damage to the power supply.
Adding Voltage Gain
The crowbar of Fig. 13-17 is a prototype,  a basic circuit that can be modifi  ed and 
improved. It is adequate for many applications as is. But it suffers from a soft 
turn-on  because the knee at zener breakdown is curved rather than sharp. When 
we take into account the tolerance in zener voltages, the soft turn-on can result in 
the supply voltage becoming dangerously high before the SCR fi  res.
One way to overcome the soft turn-on is by adding some voltage gain, as 
shown in Fig. 13-18. Normally, the transistor is off. But when the output voltage 
increases, the transistor eventually turns on and produces a large voltage across 
R4. Since the transistor provides a swamped voltage gain of approximately R4/R3, 
a small overvoltage can trigger the SCR.
Notice that an ordinary diode is being used, not a zener diode. This diode 
temperature compensates the transistor’s base-emitter diode. The trigger adjust
allows us to set the trip point  of the circuit, typically around 10 to 15 percent 
above the normal voltage.
IC Voltage Gain
Figure 13-19 shows an even better solution. The triangular box is an IC amplifi  er 
called a comparator  (discussed in later chapters). This amplifi  er has a noninvert-
ing ( 1) input and an inverting ( 2) input. When the noninverting input is greater 
than the inverting input, the output is positive. When the inverting input is greater 
than the noninverting input, the output is negative.
The amplifi  er has a very large voltage gain, typically 100,000 or more. 
Because of its large voltage gain, the circuit can detect the slightest overvoltage. 
The zener diode produces 10 V, which goes to the minus input of the amplifi  er. 
When the supply voltage is 20 V (normal output), the trigger adjust is set to pro-
duce slightly less than 10 V on the positive input. Since the negative input is 
greater than the positive, the amplifi  er output is negative and the SCR is open.Figure 13-18  Adding transistor gain to crowbar.

becomes greater than 10 V. Then, the amplifi  er output becomes positive and the 
SCR fi  res. This rapidly shuts down the supply by crowbarring the load terminals.
Integrated Crowbar
The simplest solution is to use an IC crowbar, as shown in Fig. 13-20. This is an 
integrated circuit with a built-in zener diode, transistors, and an SCR. The RCA 
SK9345 series of IC crowbars is an example of what is commercially available. 
The SK9345 protects power supplies of 15 V , the SK9346 protects 112 V , and 
the SK9347 protects 115 V .
If an SK9345 is used in Fig. 13-20, it will protect the load with a supply 
voltage of 15 V. The data sheet of an SK9345 indicates that it fi  res at 16.6 V 
with a tolerance of 60.2 V. This means that it fi  res between 6.4 and 6.8 V. Since 7 
V is the maximum rating of many digital ICs, the SK9345 protects the load under 
all operating conditions.Figure 13-19  Adding IC ampliﬁ  er to crowbar.

Table 13-1 shows some commercially available SCRs. The gate trigger voltages 
vary from 0.8 to 2 V , and the gate trigger currents range from 200 /H9262A to 50 mA. 
Also notice that anode currents vary from 1.5 to 70 A. Devices like these can 
 control heavy industrial loads by using phase control.

the current through a heavy load. In this circuit, variable resistor R1 and capacitor Figure 13-21  Example.

about the exact supply voltage at which the SCR turns on. For instance, the 
1N4734A has a tolerance of 65 percent, which means that the breakdown voltage 
may vary from 5.32 to 5.88 V. Furthermore, the trigger voltage of a 2N4441 has a 
worst-case maximum of 1.5 V. So, the overvoltage can be as high as:

phase with the line voltage, and the SCR acts like a half-wave rectifi  er. R2 limits 
the gate current to a safe level.
When R1 increases, however, the ac gate voltage lags the line voltage by an 
angle between 0° and 90°, as shown in Figs. 13-22 b and c. Before the trigger point 
shown in Fig. 13-22 c, the SCR is off and the load current is zero. At the trigger 
point, the capacitor voltage is large enough to trigger the SCR. When this happens, 
almost all of the line voltage appears across the load and the load current becomes 
high.  Ideally, the SCR remains latched until the line voltage reverses polarity. This 
is shown in Figs. 13-22 c and d.Figure 13-22   SCR phase control.

in Fig. 13-22 a. The angle between the start and end of conduction is called the 
conduction angle,  shown as /H9258conduction . The RC phase controller of Fig. 13-22 a
can change the fi  ring angle between 0° and 90°, which means that the conduction 
angle changes from 180° to 90°.
The shaded portions of Fig. 13-22 b show when the SCR is conducting. 
 Because R1 is variable, the phase angle of the gate voltage can be changed. This 
 allows us to control the shaded portions of the line voltage. Stated another way: We 
can control the average current through the load. This is useful for changing the speed 
of a motor, the brightness of a lamp, or the temperature of an induction furnace.
By using circuit analysis techniques studied in basic electricity courses, 
we can determine the approximate phase-shifted voltage across the capacitor. 
This gives us the approximate fi  ring angle and conduction angle of the circuit. To 
 determine the voltage across the capacitor, use the following steps:
First, fi  nd the capacitive reactance of C by:
XC 5   1 ____ 2/H9266fc  
The impedance and phase angle of the RC phase-shift circuit is:
ZT 5  Ï— R2 1 XC2   (13-4)

Now, the voltage value and phase of the capacitor can be found by:
VC 5 (IC//H9258)(XC/290°)
The amount of delayed phase shift will be the approximate fi  ring angle of the 
 circuit. The conduction angle is found by subtracting the fi  ring angle from 180°.GOOD TO KNOW
In Fig. 13-22 a, another RC
phase-shifting network can be 
added to provide control from 
approximately 0° to 180°.

the average current through the load. The controllable range of current is limited 
 because the phase angle can change from only 0° to 90°. With op amps and more 
sophisticated RC circuits, we can change the phase angle from 0° to 180°. This 
 allows us to vary the average current all the way from zero to maximum.

(b)Thyristors 545Critical Rate of Rise
When ac voltage is used to supply the anode of an SCR, it is possible to get false 
triggering. Because of capacitances inside an SCR, rapidly changing supply volt-
ages may trigger the SCR. To avoid false triggering of an SCR, the rate of voltage 
change must not exceed the critical rate of voltage rise  specifi  ed on the data sheet. 
For instance, the 2N6504 has a critical rate of voltage rise of 50 V/ /H9262s. To avoid 
false triggering, the anode voltage must not rise faster than 50 V/ /H9262s.
Switching transients is the main cause of exceeding the critical rate of 
voltage rise. One way to reduce the effects of switching transients is with an RC 
snubber,  shown in Fig. 13-23 a. If a high-speed switching transient does appear 
on the supply voltage, its rate of rise is reduced at the anode because of the RC
time constant.
Large SCRs also have a critical rate of current rise.  For instance, the 
C701 has a critical rate of current rise of 150 A/ /H9262s. If the anode current tries to 
rise faster than this, the SCR will be destroyed. Including an inductor in series 
with the load (Fig. 13-23 b) reduces the rate of current rise to a safe level.
13-5  Bidirectional Thyristors
The two devices discussed so far, the four-layer diode and the SCR, are unidi-
rectional because current can fl  ow in only one direction. The diac and triac  are 
bidirectional thyristors.  These devices can conduct in either direction. The diac is 
sometimes called a silicon bidirectional switch (SBS).
Diac
The diac can latch current in either direction. The equivalent circuit of a diac is 
two four-layer diodes in parallel, as shown in Fig. 13-24 a, ideally the same as 
the latches in Fig. 13-24 b. The diac is nonconducting until the voltage across it 
 exceeds the breakover voltage in either direction.
For instance, if v has the polarity indicated in Fig. 13-24 a, the left diode 
conducts when v exceeds the breakover voltage. In this case, the left latch closes, 
as shown in Fig. 13-24 c. When v has the opposite polarity, the right latch closes. 
Figure 13-24 d shows the schematic symbol for a diac.
Triac
The triac acts like two SCRs in reverse parallel (Fig. 13-25 a), equivalent to the 
two latches of Fig. 13-25 b. Because of this, the triac can control current in both 
 directions. If v has the polarity shown in Fig. 13-25 a, a positive trigger will close

dimmer controls.
v
–+

latch. Figure 13-25 c is the schematic symbol for a triac.
 Figure 13-26 shows the data sheet for a FKPF8N80 triac. As the name 
triac implies, it is a bidirectional (ac) triode thyristor. Notice at the end of the 
data sheet the quadrant defi  nitions or modes of triac operation. The triac normally 
 operates in quadrants I and III during typical ac applications. Since this device is 
most sensitive in quadrant I, a diac is often used in conjunction with the triac to 
provide symmetrical ac conduction.
 Table 13-2 shows some commercially available triacs. Because of their 
internal structure, triacs have higher gate trigger voltages and currents than com-
parable SCRs. As you can see, the gate trigger voltages of Table 13-2 are from 2 
to 2.5 V and the gate trigger currents are from 10 to 50 mA. The maximum anode 
currents are from 1 to 15 A.
Phase Control
Figure 13-27 a shows an RC circuit that varies the phase angle of the gate 
voltage to a triac. The circuit can control the current through a heavy load. 
Figures 13-27 b and c show the line voltage and lagging gate voltage. When the 
 capacitor voltage is large enough to supply the trigger current, the triac con-
ducts. Once on, the triac continues to conduct until the line voltage returns to 
zero. Figures 13-27 d and 13-27 e show the respective voltages across the triac 
and the load.
 Although triacs can handle large currents, they are not in the same class 
as SCRs, which have much higher current ratings. Nevertheless, when conduction 
on both half-cycles is important, triacs are useful devices, especially in industrial 
applications.Figure 13-25   Triac.

Figure 13-28 shows a triac crowbar that can be used to protect equipment against 
excessive line voltage. If the line voltage becomes too high, the diac breaks over 
and triggers the triac. When the triac fi  res, it blows the fuse. A potentiometer R2
allows us to set the trigger point.Figure 13-28   Triac crowbar.

is the same for both the positive

the applied voltage.

In Fig. 13-29, the switch is closed. If the triac has fi  red, what is the approximate 
current through the 22- V load resistor?
SOLUTION   Ideally, the triac has zero volts across it when conducting. There-
fore, the current through the 22- V resistor is:
I 5   75 V _____ 22 V   5 3.41 A
If the triac has 1 or 2 V across it, the current is still close to 3.41 A because the 
large supply voltage swamps the effect of the triac on voltage.

Basic Construction
Power MOSFETs and BJTs can both be used in high-power switching applica-
tions. The MOSFET has the advantage of greater switching speed, and the BJT 
has lower conduction losses. By combining the low conduction loss of a BJT 
with the switching speed of a power MOSFET, we can begin to approach an ideal 
switch.
 This hybrid device exists and is called an insulated-gate bipolar 
 transistor (IGBT).  The IGBT has essentially evolved from power MOSFET 
technology. Its structure and operation closely resembles a power MOSFET. 
Figure 13-30 shows the basic structure of an n-channel IGBT. Its structure resem-
bles an n-channel power MOSFET constructed on a p-type substrate. As shown, it 
has gate, emitter, and collector leads.
 Two versions of this device are referred to as punch-through (PT) and 
nonpunch-through (NPT) IGBTs. Figure 13-30 shows the structure of a PT IGBT. 
The PT IGBT has an n1 buffer layer between its p1 and n2 regions, and the NPT 
device has no n1 buffer layer.
Figure 13-30   Basic IGBT structure.
Example 13-9
In Fig. 13-29, the switch is closed. The MPT32 is a diac with a breakover  voltage 
of 32 V. If the triac has a trigger voltage of 1 V and a trigger current of 10 mA, 
what is the capacitor voltage that triggers the triac?
SOLUTION   As the capacitor charges, the voltage across the diac increases. 
When the diac voltage is slightly less than 32 V , the diac is on the verge of break-
over. Since the triac has a trigger voltage of 1 V , the capacitor voltage needs to be:
Vin 5 32 V 1 1 V 5 33 V
At this input voltage, the diac breaks over and triggers the triac.

Substrate (injecting layer)552 Chapter 13 NPT versions have higher conduction VCE(on) values than PT versions 
and a positive temperature coeffi  cient. The positive temperature coeffi  cient makes 
the NPT suited for paralleling. PT versions, with the extra n1 layer, have the 
 advantage of higher switching speeds. They also have a negative temperature 
 coeffi  cient. Along with the basic structure shown in Fig. 13-30, other IGBTs are 
manufactured with various advanced technology structures. One such version is 
the fi  eld-stop IGBT (FS IGBT). The FS IGBT combines the advantages of PT and 
NTP IGBTs while overcoming the disadvantages of each structure.
IGBT Control
Figures 13-31 a and b show two common schematic symbols for an n-channel 
IGBT. Notice in Fig. 13-31 b the intrinsic body-diode.  This built-in diode is simi-
lar to the body-diodes found in power FETs. Also, Fig. 13-31 c shows a simplifi  ed 
equivalent circuit for this device. As you can see, the IGBT is essentially a power 
MOSFET on the input side and a BJT on the output side. The input control is a 
voltage between the gate and emitter leads. Just as in a power FET, the gate drive 
circuits for an IGBT must be able to quickly charge up and discharge the IGBT’s 
input capacitance for fast switching speeds. The output is a current between the 
collector and emitter leads.  Because the output of the IGBT relies on BJT con-
struction, this results in a slower device turn-off speed than a power FET.
 The IGBT is a normally off high-input impedance device. When the input 
voltage VGE is large enough, collector current will begin to fl  ow. This minimum 
voltage value is the gate threshold voltage VGE(th). Figure 13-32 shows the data 
sheet for a FGL60N100BNTD IGBT using NPT-Trench technology. The typical 
VGE(th) for this device is listed as 5.0 V when IC 5 60 mA. The maximum contin-
uous collector current is shown to be 60 A. Another important characteristic is its 
collector to emitter saturation voltage VCE(sat). The typical VCE(sat) value, shown 
on the data sheet, is 1.5 V at a collector current of 10 A and 2.5 V at a  collector 
current of 60 A.
IGBT Advantages
Conduction losses of IGBTs are related to the forward voltage drop of the 
device, and the MOSFET conduction loss is based on its RDS(on) values. For 
low-voltage applications, power MOSFETs can have extremely low RD(on) re-
sistances. In high-voltage applications, however, MOSFETs have increased 
RDS(on) values, resulting in increased conduction losses. The IGBT does not have Figure 13-31   IGBTs: ( a) and ( b) Schematic symbols; ( c) simpliﬁ  ed equivalent circuit.

Application Example 13-10
What does the circuit of Fig. 13-33 do?
SOLUTION   The simplifi  ed schematic diagram of Fig. 13-33 is a single-ended (SE) resonant inverter. It can be used in 
induction heating (IH) applications for effi  cient energy use. This type of inverter can be found in electric home appliances 
such as cookers, rice jars, and inverterized microwave ovens. So how does this circuit work?
 The 220 Vac input is rectifi  ed by the bridge rectifi  er diodes D1-D4. L1 and C1 form a low-pass, choke-input fi  lter. 
At the output of the fi  lter is the required dc voltage for the inverter. The primary coil of L2, with its equivalent dc resistance 
Req, and C2 create a parallel resonant tank circuit. L2 also serves as the primary heating coil winding of a transformer. The 
secondary of this transformer and its load is a ferrous metal element with low resistance and high permeability. This load 
essentially works as a one turn secondary winding with a shorted load and becomes the cooking or heating surface.
 Q 1 is an IGBT with fast switching speeds, low VCE(sat), and high blocking voltage. D5 can either be a co-packaged 
anti-parallel diode or an intrinsic body-diode. The gate of the IGBT is connected to a gate drive control circuit. The gate dri ve 
circuit is normally under control of a microcontroller unit (MCU).
 When Q1 receives a proper gate input signal, it turns on allowing current to fl  ow through L2 and the collector to 
emitter of the IGBT. The current fl  ow though the primary of L2 creates an expanding magnetic fi  eld which cuts across the 
secondary heating element load winding. When Q1 turns off, the energy stored in the magnetic fi  eld of L2 collapses and 
charges up C2. This creates a high positive voltage on the collector of Q1, which uses its high blocking voltage ability to 
remain off. C2 will return its energy by discharging through L2 in the opposite direction, creating a parallel resonant os-
cillating current. The expanding and collapsing magnetic fi  eld of L2 cuts across the load element. Normally, heat losses as 
the result of eddy currents are reduced by using laminations. Because the load element does not use laminations, this heat Vin

voltage as compared to the VDSS maximum value of MOSFETs. As shown in 
the data sheet of Fig. 13-32, the VCES value is 1000 V . This is important in ap-
plications using higher-voltage inductive loads, such as inductive heating (IH) 
applications. This makes the IGBT ideal for high-voltage full H-bridge and 
half-bridge circuits. 
 As compared to BJTs, IGBTs have a much higher input impedance and 
have much simpler gate drive requirements. Although the IGBT cannot match 
the switching speed of the MOSFET, new IGBT families, such as FS IGBTs, are 
being developed for high-frequency applications. IGBTs are, therefore, effective 
solutions for high-voltage and current applications at moderate frequencies.556 Chapter 1313-7 Other Thyristors
SCRs, triacs, and IGBTs are important thyristors. But there are others worth 
 looking at briefl  y. Some of these thyristors, like the photo-SCR, are still used in 
special applications. Others, like the UJT, were popular at one time but have been 
mostly replaced by op amps and timer ICs.
Photo-SCR
Figure 13-34 a shows a photo-SCR,  also known as a light-activated SCR.  The 
 arrows represent incoming light that passes through a window and hits the de-
pletion layers. When the light is strong enough, valence electrons are dislodged 
from their orbits and become free electrons. The fl  ow of free electrons starts the 
positive feedback, and the photo-SCR closes.
After a light trigger has closed the photo-SCR, it remains closed, even 
though the light disappears. For maximum sensitivity to light, the gate is left 
open, as shown in Fig. 13-34 a. To get an adjustable trip point, we can include the 
trigger adjust shown in Fig. 13-34 b. The resistance between the gate and ground 
 diverts some of the light-produced electrons and reduces the sensitivity of the 
 circuit to the incoming light.
Gate-Controlled Switch
As mentioned earlier, low-current drop-out is the normal way to open an SCR. 
But the gate-controlled switch  is designed for easy opening with a reverse-
biased trigger. A gate-controlled switch is closed by a positive trigger and opened 
by a negative trigger.
Figure 13-35 shows a gate-controlled circuit. Each positive trigger closes 
the gate-controlled switch, and each negative trigger opens it. Because of this, 
we get the square-wave output shown. The gate-controlled switch has been used 
in counters, digital circuits, and other applications in which a negative trigger is 
available.
Silicon Controlled Switch
Figure 13-36 a shows the doped regions of a silicon controlled switch.  Now an 
external lead is connected to each doped region. Visualize the device separated 
into two halves (Fig. 13-36 b). Therefore, it’s equivalent to a latch with access 
to both bases (Fig. 13-36 c). A forward-bias trigger on either base will close the Figure 13-34   Photo-SCR.

loss can be turned into productive heat energy. This is the principle of inductive heating (IH). To increase the effectiveness 
of this inductive heating process, the values of L2 and C2 are chosen to create a resonant frequency from 20 to 100 kHz. 
The higher the frequency of the coil current, the more intense the induced current fl  owing around the surface of the load, 
called skin-effect .
 Effi  ciency of this resonant inverter is critical. One of the major power losses of this circuit is switching losses of the 
IGBT. Higher energy conversion effi  ciency is obtained by controlling the IGBT’s voltage or current at the moment of switch-
ing. This is known as soft-switching . The voltage or current applied to the switching circuit can be made approximately zero 
by using the resonance created by the LC resonant circuit and the anti-parallel diode across the collector to emitter of the 
IGBT. Gate switch control from the MCU has the voltage of the switching circuit VCE set to zero right before the circuit is 
turned on (ZVS) and having the IGBT current fl  ow close to zero (ZCS) right before turning it off.
 Maximum power is delivered to the load element when the gate drive signal is at the resonant frequency of the LC
tank circuit. By regulating the frequency and duty cycle of the gate drive, the temperature of the load can be controlled.Thyristors 557 silicon controlled switch. Likewise, a reverse-bias trigger on either base will open 
the device.
Figure 13-36 d shows the schematic symbol for a silicon controlled 
switch. The lower gate is called the cathode gate,  and the upper gate is the anode 
gate.  The silicon controlled switch is a low-power device compared to the SCR. 
It handles currents in milliamperes rather than amperes.
Unijunction Transistor and PUT
The unijunction transistor (UJT)  has two doped regions, as shown in Fig. 13-37 a. 
When the input voltage is zero, the device is nonconducting. When we increase 
the input voltage above the standoff voltage  (given on a data sheet), the resistance Figure 13-35   Gate-controlled switch.

Fig. 13-37 b. Figure 13-37 c is the schematic symbol for a UJT.
 The UJT can be used to form a pulse-generating circuit called a UJT 
 relaxation oscillator, as shown in Fig. 13-38. In this circuit, the capacitor charges 
toward VBB. When the capacitor voltage reaches a value equal to the standoff volt-
age, the UJT turns on. The internal lower base (lower n region) resistance quickly 
drops in value allowing the capacitor to discharge. The capacitor discharge con-
tinues until low-current drop-out occurs. When this happens, the UJT turns off 
and the capacitor begins to once again charge toward VBB. The charging RC time 
constant is normally signifi  cantly larger than the discharge time constant.
 The sharp pulse waveform developed across the external resistor at B1 
can be used as a trigger source for controlling the conduction angle of SCR and 
triac circuits. The waveform developed across the capacitor can be used in appli-
cations where a sawtooth generator is needed.
 The programmable unijunction transistor (PUT)  is a four-layer pnpn  
device, which is used to produce trigger pulses and waveforms similar to UJT 
 circuits. The schematic symbol is shown in Fig. 13-39 a.
 Its basic construction, shown in Fig. 13-39 b, is very different from a UJT, 
more closely resembling an SCR. The gate lead is connected to the n layer next to 
the anode. This pn junction is used to control the on and off states of the device. 
The cathode terminal is connected to a voltage point lower than the gate, typically 
at a ground point. When the anode voltage becomes approximately 0.7 V higher 
than the gate voltage, the PUT turns on. The device will remain in the on state 
until its anode current falls below the rated holding current, normally given as its 
valley current IV. When this happens, the device returns to its off state.
 The PUT is considered to be programmable because the gate voltage 
can be determined by an external voltage divider. This is shown in Fig. 13-39 c. 
The external resistors R2 and R3 establish the gate voltage VG. By changing these 
 resistor values, the voltage on the gate can be modifi  ed or “programmed,” thus 
changing the required anode voltage for fi  ring. When the capacitor charges up Figure 13-38   UJT relaxation oscillator.

that point, the PUT turns and the capacitor discharges. As with the UJT, sawtooth 
and trigger-pulse waveforms can be developed for controlling thyristors.
 UJTs and PUTs were popular at one time for building oscillators, timers, 
and other circuits. But, as mentioned earlier, op amps and timer ICs (such as the 
555), along with microcontrollers, have replaced these devices in many of their 
applications.
13-8  Troubleshooting
When you troubleshoot a circuit to fi  nd faulty resistors, diodes, transistors, and 
so on, you are troubleshooting at the component level.  The troubleshooting 
problems of earlier chapters gave you practice at the component level. Trouble-
shooting at this level is an excellent foundation for troubleshooting at higher 
levels because it teaches you how to think logically, using Ohm’s law as your 
guide.
Now, we want to practice troubleshooting at the system level.  This 
means thinking in terms of functional blocks,  which are the smaller jobs being 
done by the different parts of the overall circuit. To get the idea of this higher level 
of  troubleshooting, look at the troubleshooting section at the end of this chapter 
(Fig. 13-49).
Here you see a block diagram of a power supply with an SCR crow-
bar. The power supply has been drawn in terms of its functional blocks. If you 
measure the voltages at the different points, you can often isolate the trouble to 
a particular block. Then you can continue troubleshooting at the component level, 
if necessary.
Often, a manufacturer’s instruction manual includes block diagrams of 
the equipment in which the function of each block is specifi  ed. For instance, a 
television receiver can be drawn in terms of its functional blocks. Once you know 
what the input and output signals of each block are supposed to be, you can trou-
bleshoot the television receiver to isolate the defective block. After you isolate the 
defective block, you can either replace the entire block or continue troubleshoot-
ing at the component level.Figure 13-39   PUT: ( a) symbol; ( b) structure; ( c) PUT circuit.

SEC. 13-1   THE FOUR-LAYER 
DIODE
A thyristor is a semiconductor device 
that uses internal positive feedback 
to produce latching action. The four-
layer diode, also called a Schockley 
diode, is the simplest thyristor. Break-
over closes it, and low-current drop-
out opens it.
SEC. 13-2   THE SILICON 
 CONTROLLED 
RECTIFIER
The silicon controlled rectiﬁ  er (SCR) 
is the most widely used thyristor. It 
can switch very large currents on and 
off . To turn it on, we need to apply 
a minimum gate trigger voltage and 
current. To turn it off  , we need to 
reduce the anode voltage to almost 
zero.
SEC. 13-3  THE SCR CROWBAR
One important application of the SCR 
is to protect delicate and expensive 
loads against supply overvoltages. 
With an SCR crowbar, a fuse or 
current-limiting circuit is needed to prevent excessive current from dam-
aging the power supply.
SEC. 13-4   SCR PHASE 
CONTROL
An RC circuit can vary the lag angle 
of gate voltage from 0° to 90°. This 
allows us to control the average load 
current. By using more advanced 
phase control circuits, we can vary 
the phase angle from 0° to 180° and 
have greater control over the aver-
age load current.
SEC. 13-5   BIDIRECTIONAL 
THYRISTORS
The diac can latch current in either 
direction. It is open until the voltage 
across it exceeds the breakover 
voltage. The triac is a gate-controlled 
device similar to an SCR. With a phase 
controller, a triac gives us full-wave 
control of the average load current.
SEC. 13-6  IGBTs
The IGBT is a hybrid device com-
posed of a power MOSFET on the 
input side and a BJT on the output 
side. This combination produces a device with simple input gate drive 
requirements and low conduction 
losses on the output. IGBTs have an 
advantage over power MOSFETs in 
high-voltage, high-current switching 
applications.
SEC. 13-7   OTHER THYRISTORS
The photo-SCR latches when the 
incoming light is strong enough. The 
gate-controlled switch is designed 
to close with a positive trigger and 
open with a negative trigger. The sil-
icon controlled switch has two input 
trigger gates, either of which can 
close or open the device. The uni-
junction transistor has been used to 
build oscillators and timing circuits.

Earlier chapters discussed ampliﬁ  ers operating in their normal 
frequency range. Now, we want to discuss how an ampliﬁ  er 
responds when the input frequency is outside this normal 
range. With ac ampliﬁ  ers, the voltage gain decreases when 
the input frequency is too low or too high. On the other hand, 
dc ampliﬁ  ers have voltage gain all the way down to zero 
frequency. It is only at higher frequencies that the voltage 
gain of a dc ampliﬁ  er falls off  . We can use decibels to describe 
the decrease in voltage gain and a Bode plot to graph the 
response of an ampliﬁ  er.

an Ampliﬁ  er
The frequency response  of an amplifi  er is the graph of its gain versus the fre-
quency. In this section, we will discuss the frequency response of ac and dc am-
plifi ers. Earlier, we discussed a CE amplifi  er with coupling and bypass capacitors. 
This is an example of an ac amplifi  er,  one designed to amplify ac signals. It is 
also possible to design a dc amplifi  er,  one that can amplify dc signals as well as 
ac  signals.
Response of an AC Ampliﬁ  er
Figure 14-1 a shows the frequency response  of an ac amplifi  er. In the middle range 
of frequencies, the voltage gain is maximum. This middle range of frequencies 
is where the amplifi  er is normally operated. At low frequencies, the voltage gain 
 decreases because the coupling and bypass capacitors no longer act like short cir-
cuits. Instead, their capacitive reactances are large enough to drop some of the ac 
signal voltage. The result is a loss of voltage gain as we approach zero hertz (0 Hz).
 At high frequencies, the voltage gain decreases for other reasons. To 
begin with, a transistor has internal capacitances  across its junctions, as shown 
in Fig. 14-1 b. These capacitances provide bypass paths for the ac signal. As the 
frequency increases, the capacitive reactances become low enough to prevent nor-
mal transistor action. The result is a loss of voltage gain.
 Stray-wiring capacitance  is another reason for a loss of voltage gain 
at high frequencies. Figure 14-1 c illustrates the idea. Any connecting wire in a 
transistor circuit acts like one plate of a capacitor, and the chassis ground acts like 
the other plate. The stray-wiring capacitance that exists between this wire and 
ground is unwanted. At higher frequencies, its low capacitive reactance prevents 
the ac current from reaching the load resistor. This is equivalent to saying that the 
voltage gain drops off.

The frequency response of an 
ampliﬁ  er can be determined 
experimentally by applying a 
square-wave signal to the ampli-
ﬁ  er input and noting the output re-
sponse. As you recall from earlier 
studies, a square wave contains 
a fundamental frequency and an 
inﬁ  nite number of odd-order har-
monics. The shape of the output 
square wave will reveal whether 
the low and high frequencies are 
being properly ampliﬁ  ed. The fre-
quency of the square wave should 
be approximately one-tenth the 
frequency of the upper cutoff   
frequency of the ampliﬁ  er. If the 
output square wave is an exact 
replica of the input square wave, 
the frequency response of the 
ampliﬁ  er is obviously suffi   cient for 
the applied frequency.Frequency Effects 571Cutoff   Frequencies
The frequencies at which the voltage gain equals 0.707 of its maximum value are 
called the cutoff frequencies.  In Fig. 14-1 a, f1 is the lower cutoff frequency and 
f2 is the upper cutoff frequency. The cutoff frequencies are also referred to as the 
half-power frequencies  because the load power is half of its maximum value at 
these frequencies.
 Why is the output power half of maximum at the cutoff frequencies? 
When the voltage gain is 0.707 of the maximum value, the output voltage is 0.707 
of the maximum value. Recall that power equals the square of voltage divided by 
resistance. When you square 0.707, you get 0.5. This is why the load power is half 
of its maximum value at the cutoff frequencies.
Midband
We will defi  ne the midband of an amplifi  er as the band of frequencies between 
10f1 and 0.1 f2. In the midband, the voltage gain of the amplifi  er is approximately 
maximum, designated by Av(mid). Three important characteristics of any ac ampli-
fi er are its Av(mid), f1, and f2. Given these values, we know how much voltage gain 
there is in the midband and where the voltage gain is down to 0.707 Av(mid).
Outside the Midband
Although an amplifi  er normally operates in the midband, there are times when we 
want to know what the voltage gain is outside of the midband. Here is an approx-
imation for calculating the voltage gain of an ac amplifi  er:
Av 5   Av(mid)  _____________________   
 Ï— 1 1 (f1/f)2    Ï— 1 1 (f/f2)2     (14-1)
Given Av(mid), f1, and f2, we can calculate the voltage gain at any frequency f. 
This equation assumes that one dominant capacitor is producing the lower cutoff 
 frequency and one dominant capacitor is producing the upper cutoff frequency. A 
dominant capacitor  is one that is more important than all others in determining 
the cutoff frequency.
 Equation (14-1) is not as formidable as it fi  rst appears. There are only 
three frequency ranges to analyze: the midband, below midband, and above mid-
band. In the midband, f1/f < 0 and f/f2 < 0. Therefore, both radicals in Eq. (14-1) 
are approximately 1, and Eq. (14-1) simplifi  es to:
Midband: Av 5 Av(mid) (14-2)
 Below the midband, f/f2 < 0. As a result, the second radical equals 1 and 
Eq. (14-1) simplifi  es to:
Below midband: Av 5   Av(mid) __________  
 Ï— 1 1 (f1/f)2      (14-3)
Above midband, f1/f < 0. As a result, the fi  rst radical equals 1 and Eq. (14-1) 
simplifi  es to:
Above midband: Av 5   Av(mid) __________  
 Ï— 1 1 (f/f2)2      (14-4)
Response of a DC Ampliﬁ  er
When required a designer can use direct coupling between amplifi  er stages. This 
allows the circuit to amplify all the way down to zero hertz (0 Hz). This type of 
amplifi  er is called a dc amplifi  er.GOOD TO KNOW
In Fig. 14-2, the bandwidth 
includes the frequencies from 
0 Hz up to f2. To say it another 
way, the bandwidth in Fig. 14-2 
equals  f2.572 Chapter 14 Figure 14-2 a shows the frequency response of a dc amplifi  er. Since there 
is no lower cutoff frequency, the two important characteristics of a dc amplifi  er 
are Av(mid) and f2. Given these two values on a data sheet, we have the voltage gain 
of the amplifi  er in the midband and its upper cutoff frequency.
 The dc amplifi  er is more widely used than the ac amplifi  er because most 
amplifi  ers are now being designed with op amps instead of with discrete transis-
tors. An op amp  is a dc amplifi  er that has high voltage gain, high input impedance, 
and low output impedance. A wide variety of op amps are commercially available 
as integrated circuits (ICs).
 Most dc amplifi  ers are designed with one dominant capacitance that pro-
duces the cutoff frequency f2. Because of this, we can use the following formula 
to calculate the voltage gain of typical dc amplifi  ers:
Av 5   Av(mid) __________  
 Ï— 1 1 (f/f2)2      (14-5)
For instance, when f 5 0.1f2:
Av 5   Av(mid) __________  
 Ï— 1 1 (0.1)2     5 0.995 Av(mid)
This says that the voltage gain is within a half percent of maximum when the input 
frequency is one-tenth of the upper cutoff frequency. In other words, the voltage 
gain is approximately 100 percent of maximum .Av

With Eq. (14-5), we can calculate the voltage gain in the region between midband 
and cutoff. Summary Table 14-1 shows the normalized values of frequency and 
voltage gain. When f/f2 5 0.1, Av/Av(mid) 5 0.995. When f/f2 increases, the nor-
malized voltage gain decreases until it reaches 0.707 at the cutoff frequency. As 
an  approximation, we can say that the voltage gain is 100 percent of maximum 
when f/f2 5 0.1. Then, it decreases to 98 percent, 96 percent, and so on, until it is 
 approximately 70 percent at the cutoff frequency. Figure 14-2 b shows the graph 
of Av/Av(mid) versus f/f2.Summary Table 14-1Between Midband

Example 14-1
Figure 14-3 a shows an ac amplifi  er with a midband voltage gain of 200. If the cut-
off frequencies are f1 5 20 Hz and f2 5 20 kHz, what does the frequency  response 
look like? What is the voltage gain if the input frequency is 5 Hz? If it is 200 kHz?
SOLUTION   In the midband, the voltage gain is 200. At either cutoff 
 frequency, it equals:
Av 5 0.707(200) 5 141
Figure 14-3 b shows the frequency response.
 With Eq. (14-3), we can calculate the voltage gain for an input frequency 
of 5 Hz:
Av 5   200 ____________

 Ï——  1 1 (200/20)2     5 19.9

We are about to discuss decibels,  a useful method for describing frequency 
 response. But before we do, we need to review some ideas from basic mathematics.
Review of Logarithms
Suppose we are given this equation:
x5 10y (14-6)
It can be solved for y in terms of x to get:
y 5 log 10x
10 Hz, the voltage gain decreases until it equals approximately 70  percent of 
maximum.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 14-2   Repeat Example 14-2 with Av(mid) 5 200,000.
Example 14-3
In the preceding example, what is the voltage gain for each of the following input 
frequencies: 100 Hz, 1 kHz, 10 kHz, 100 kHz, and 1 MHz?
SOLUTION   Since the cutoff frequency is 10 Hz, an input frequency of:
f 5 100 Hz, 1 kHz, 10 kHz, . . . 
gives a ratio f/f2 of:
f/f2 5 10, 100, 1000, . . . 
Therefore, we can use Eq. (14-5) as follows to calculate the voltage gains:
f 5 100 Hz:  Av 5   100,000 __________  
 Ï— 1 1 (10)2     < 10,000
f 5 1 kHz: Av 5   100,000 ___________  
 Ï— 1 1 (100)2     5 1000
f 5 10 kHz: Av 5   100,000 _____________   
 Ï—— 1 1 (1,000)2     5 100
f 5 100 kHz: Av 5   100,000 ______________   
 Ï——  1 1 (10,000)2     5 10
f 5 1 MHz: Av 5   100,000 _______________   
 Ï——  1 1 (100,000)2     5 1
Each time the frequency increases by a decade  (a factor of 10), the voltage gain 
decreases by a factor of 10.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 14-3   Repeat Example 14-3 with Av(mid) 5 200,000.576 Chapter 14This says that y is the logarithm (or exponent) of 10 that gives x. Usually, the 10 
is omitted, and the equation is written as:
y 5 log x (14-7)
 With a calculator that has the common log function, you can quickly fi  nd 
the y value for any x value. For instance, here is how to calculate the value of y for 
x 5 10, 100, and 1000:
y 5 log 10 5 1
y 5 log 100 5 2
y 5 log 1000 5 3
As you can see, each time x increases by a factor of 10, y increases by 1.
 You can also calculate y values, given decimal values of x. For instance, 
here are the values of y for x 5 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001:
y 5 log 0.1 5 21
y 5 log 0.01 5 22
y 5 log 0.001 5 23
Each time x decreases by a factor of 10, y decreases by 1.
Deﬁ  nition of Ap(dB)
In a previous chapter, power gain Ap was defi  ned as the output power divided by 
the input power:
Ap 5   pout ___ pin  
 Decibel power gain  is defi  ned as:
Ap(dB) 5 10 log Ap (14-8)
Since Ap is the ratio of output power to input power, Ap has no units or dimensions. 
When you take the logarithm of Ap, you get a quantity that has no units or dimen-
sions. But to make sure that Ap(dB) is never confused with Ap, we attach the unit 
decibel  (abbreviated dB) to all answers for  Ap(dB).
 For instance, if an amplifi  er has a power gain of 100, it has a decibel 
power gain of:
Ap(dB) 5 10 log 100 5 20 dB
As another example, if Ap 5 100,000,000, then:
Ap(dB) 5 10 log 100,000,000 5 80 dB
 In both of these examples, the log equals the number of zeros: 100 has 
two zeros, and 100,000,000 has eight zeros. You can use the zero count to fi  nd the 
logarithm whenever the number is a multiple of 10. Then, you can multiply by 10 
to get the decibel answer. For instance, a power gain of 1000 has three zeros; mul-
tiply by 10 to get 30 dB. A power gain of 100,000 has fi  ve zeros; multiply by 10 
to get 50 dB. This shortcut is useful for fi  nding decibel equivalents and checking 
answers.
 Decibel power gain is often used on data sheets to specify the power gain 
of devices. One reason for using decibel power gain is that logarithms compress 
numbers. For instance, if an amplifi  er has a power gain that varies from 100 to 
100,000,000, the decibel power gain varies from 20 to 80 dB. As you can see, 
decibel power gain is a more compact notation than ordinary power gain.Frequency Effects 577Two Useful Properties
Decibel power gain has two useful properties:
1. Each time the ordinary power gain increases (decreases) by a factor of 
2, the decibel power gain increases (decreases) by 3 dB.
2. Each time the ordinary power gain increases (decreases) by a factor of 
10, the decibel power gain increases (decreases) by 10 dB.
Summary Table 14-2 shows these properties in compact form. The following ex-
amples will demonstrate these properties.Summary Table 14-2 Properties of Power Gain

Ap(dB) 5 10 log 1 5 0 dB
Ap(dB) 5 10 log 2 5 3 dB
Ap(dB) 5 10 log 4 5 6 dB
Ap(dB) 5 10 log 8 5 9 dB
Each time Ap increases by a factor of 2, the decibel power gain increases by 3 dB. 
This property is always true. Whenever you double the power gain, the decibel 
power gain increases by 3 dB.

PRACTICE PROBLEM  14-7   Calculate the decibel power gain for Ap

V oltage measurements are more common than power measurements. For this rea-
son, decibels are even more useful with voltage gain.
Deﬁ nition
As defi  ned in earlier chapters, voltage gain is the output voltage divided by the 
input voltage:
Av 5   vout ___ vin  
 Decibel voltage gain  is defi  ned as:
Av(dB) 5 20 log Av (14-9)
The reason for using 20 instead of 10 in this defi  nition is because power is pro-
portional to the square of voltage. As will be discussed in the next section, this 
 defi nition produces an important derivation for impedance-matched systems.
 If an amplifi  er has a voltage gain of 100,000, it has a decibel voltage 
gain of:
Av(dB) 5 20 log 100,000 5 100 dB
We can use a shortcut whenever the number is a multiple of 10. Count the num-
ber of zeros and multiply by 20 to get the decibel equivalent. In the foregoing 
calculation, count fi  ve zeros and multiply by 20 to get the decibel voltage gain 
of 100 dB.
 As another example, if an amplifi  er has a voltage gain that varies from 
100 to 100,000,000, then its decibel voltage gain varies from 40 to 160 dB.
Basic Rules for Voltage Gain
Here are the useful properties for decibel voltage gain:
1. Each time the voltage gain increases (decreases) by a factor of 2, the 
decibel voltage gain increases (decreases) by 6 dB.
2. Each time the voltage gain increases (decreases) by a factor of 10, the 
decibel voltage gain increases (decreases) by 20 dB.

30.1 220580 Chapter 14Cascaded Stages
In Fig. 14-5, the total voltage gain of the two-stage amplifi  er is the product of the 
individual voltage gains:
Av 5 (Av1)(Av2) (14-10)
For instance, if the fi  rst stage has a voltage gain of 100 and the second stage has a 
voltage gain of 50, the total voltage gain is:
Av 5 (100)(50) 5 5000
 Something unusual happens in Eq. (14-10) when we use the decibel volt-
age gain instead of the ordinary voltage gain:
Av(dB) 5 20 log Av 5 20 log ( Av1)(Av2) 5 20  log Av1 1 20 log Av2
This can be written as:
Av(dB) 5 Av1(dB) 1 Av2(dB)  (14-11)
 This equation says that the total decibel voltage gain of two cascaded 
stages equals the sum of the individual decibel voltage gains . The same idea ap-
plies to any number of stages. This additive property of decibel gain is one reason 
for its popularity.Av2vout vin Av1Figure 14-5   Two stages of voltage gain.
Example 14-8
What is the total voltage gain in Fig. 14-6 a? Express this in decibels. Next, 
 calculate the decibel voltage gain of each stage and the total decibel voltage 
gain using Eq. (14-11).
SOLUTION   With Eq. (14-10), the total voltage gain is:
Av 5 (100)(200) 5 20,000
In decibels, this is:
Av(dB) 5 20 log 20,000 5 86 dB
 You can use a calculator to get 86 dB, or you can use the following short-
cut: The number 20,000 is the same as 2 times 10,000. The number 10,000 has 
four zeros, which means that the decibel equivalent is 80 dB. Because of the factor 
of 2, the fi  nal answer is 6 dB higher, or 86 dB.
 Next, we can calculate the decibel voltage gain of each stage as follows:
Av1(dB) 5 20 log 100 5 40 dB
Av2(dB) 5 20 log 200 5 46 dBFrequency Effects 58114-4  Impedance Matching
Figure 14-7 a shows an amplifi  er stage with a generator resistance of RG, an input 
resistance of Rin, an output resistance of Rout, and a load resistance of RL. Up to 
now, most of our discussions have used different impedances.
 In many communication systems (microwave, television, and telephone), 
all impedances are matched; that is, RG 5 Rin 5 Rout 5 RL. Figure 14-7 b illustrates 
the idea. As indicated, all impedances equal R. The impedance R is 50 V in mi-
crowave systems, 75 V (coaxial cable) or 300 V (twin-lead) in television systems, 
and 600 V in telephone systems. Impedance matching is used in these systems 
because it produces maximum power transfer.
 In Fig. 14-7 b, the input power is:
pin 5   vin2 ____ R  
and the output power is:
pout 5   vout2 ____ R  
Figure 14-6 b shows these decibel voltage gains. With Eq. (14-11), the total 
 decibel voltage gain is:
Av(dB) 5 40 dB 1 46 dB 5 86 dB
As you can see, adding the decibel voltage gain of each stage gives us the same 
answer calculated earlier.

GOOD TO KNOW
When the impedances are not 
matched in an amplifier, the 
decibel power gains can be 
calculated with the use of the 
following equation:
Ap(dB) 5  20 log Av 
1 10 log Rin/Rout
where Av represents the voltage 
gain of the amplifier, and Rin and 
Rout represent the input and out-
put resistances, respectively.582 Chapter 14The power gain is:
Ap 5   pout ___ pin   5   vout2/R ______ vin2/R   5   vout2 ____ vin2   5   (   vout ____ vin   )  2
 
or
Ap 5 Av2 (14-12)
This says that the power gain equals the square of the voltage gain in any 
impedance-matched system .
 In terms of decibels:
Ap(dB) 5 10 log Ap 5 10 log Av2 5 20 log Av
or
Ap(dB) 5 Av(dB) (14-13)
This says that the decibel power gain equals the decibel voltage gain . Equa-
tion (14-13) is true for any impedance-matched system. If a data sheet states that 
the gain of a system is 40 dB, then both decibel power gain and voltage gain equal 
40 dB.
Converting Decibel to Ordinary Gain
When a data sheet specifi  es the decibel power gain or voltage gain, you can con-
vert the decibel gain to ordinary gain with the following equations:
Ap 5 antilog   Ap(dB) _____ 10   (14-14)
and
Av 5 antilog   Av(dB) _____ 20   (14-15)
The antilog is the inverse logarithm. These conversions are easily done on a scien-
tifi  c calculator that has a log function and an inverse key.Routvg

vg584 Chapter 1414-5  Decibels above a Reference
In this section, we will discuss two more ways to use decibels. Besides applying 
decibels to power and voltage gains, we can use decibels above a reference.  The 
reference levels used in this section are the milliwatt and the volt.
The Milliwatt Reference
Decibels are sometimes used to indicate the power level above 1 mW. In this case, 
the label dBm is used instead of dB. The m at the end of dBm reminds us of the 
milliwatt reference. The dBm equation is:
PdBm 5 10 log   p ______ 1 mW   (14-16)
where PdBm is the power expressed in dBm. For instance, if the power is 2 W, then:
PdBm 5 10 log   2 W ______ 1 mW   5 10 log 2000 5 33 dBm
Using dBm is a way of comparing the power to 1 mW. If a data sheet says that the 
output of a power amplifi  er is 33 dBm, it is saying that the output power is 2 W. 
Summary Table 14-4 shows some dBm values.
 You can convert any dBm value to its equivalent power by using this 
equation:
P 5 antilog   PdBm _____ 10   (14-17)
where P is the power in milliwatts.
The Volt Reference
Decibels can also be used to indicate the voltage level above 1 V . In this case, the 
label dBV is used. The dBV equation is:
VdBV 5 20 log   V ____ 1 V

Audio communication systems 
that have input and output re-
sistances of 600  V use the dBm 
unit to indicate the actual power 
output of an amplifier, an attenu-
ator, or an entire system.Frequency Effects 585Since the denominator equals 1, we can simplify the equation to:
VdBV 5 20 log V (14-18)
where V is dimensionless. For instance, if the voltage is 25 V , then:
VdBV 5 20 log 25 5 28 dBV
Using dBV is a way of comparing the voltage to 1 V . If a data sheet says that the 
output of a voltage amplifi  er is 28 dBV , it is saying that the output voltage is 25 
V . If the output level or sensitivity of a microphone is specifi  ed as 240 dBV , its 
output voltage is 10 mV . Summary Table 14-5 shows some dBV values.
 You can convert any dBV value to its equivalent voltage using this 
equation:

where V is the voltage in volts.Summary Table 14-5 Voltage in dBV

The unit decibel millivolt (dBmV) 
is frequently used in cable tele-
vision systems for the measure-
ment of signal intensity. In this 
system, a signal of 1 mV across 
75V is the reference level 
that corresponds to 0 dB. The 
dBmV unit is used to indicate 
the actual output voltage of an 
amplifier, attenuator, or an entire 
system.
Example 14-11
A data sheet says that the output of an amplifi  er is 24 dBm. What is the output 
power?

PRACTICE PROBLEM 14-11   What is the power output of an amplifi  er 
rated at 50 dBm?586 Chapter 1414-6  Bode Plots
Figure 14-9 shows the frequency response of an ac amplifi  er. Although it contains 
some information such as the midband voltage gain and the cutoff frequencies, it 
is an incomplete picture of the amplifi  er’s behavior. This is where the Bode plot , 
which will be examined later in this section, comes in. Because this type of graph 
uses decibels, it can give us more information about the amplifi  er’s response out-
side the midband.
Octaves
The middle C on a piano has a frequency of 256 Hz. The next-higher C is an 
 octave higher, and it has a frequency of 512 Hz. The next-higher C has a fre-
quency of 1024 Hz, and so on. In music, the word octave  refers to a doubling of 
the frequency. Every time you go up one octave, you have doubled the frequency.
 In electronics, an octave has a similar meaning for ratios like f1/f and f/f2. 
For instance, if f1 5 100 Hz and f 5 50 Hz, the f1/f ratio is:
  f1 __ f   5   100 Hz _______ 50 Hz   5 2
We can describe this by saying that f is one octave below f1. As another example, 
suppose f5 400 kHz and f2 5 200 kHz. Then:
  f __ f2   5   400 kHz ________ 200 kHz   5 2
This means that f is one octave above f2.
Example 14-12
If a data sheet says that the output of an amplifi  er is 234 dBV, what is the output 
voltage?
SOLUTION   With Eq. (14-18):

A decade  has a similar meaning for ratios like f1/f and f/f2, except that a factor of 
10 is used instead of a factor of 2. For instance, if f1 5 500 Hz and f 5 50 Hz, the 
f1/f ratio is:
f1 __ f   5   500 Hz _______ 50 Hz   5 10
We can describe this by saying that f is one decade below f1. As another example, 
suppose f 5 2 MHz and f2 5 200 kHz. Then:
f __ f2   5   2 MHz ________ 200 kHz   5 10
This means that f is one decade above f2.
Linear and Logarithmic Scales
Ordinary graph paper has a linear scale  on both axes. This means that the spaces 
between the numbers are the same for all numbers, as shown in Fig. 14-10 a. With 
a linear scale, you start at 0 and proceed in uniform steps toward higher numbers. 
All the graphs discussed up to now have used linear scales.
 Sometimes we may prefer to use a logarithmic scale  because it com-
presses very large values and allows us to see over many decades. Figure 14-10 b
shows a logarithmic scale. Notice that the numbering begins with 1. The space 
 between 1 and 2 is much larger than the space between 9 and 10. By compressing 
the scale logarithmically as shown here, we can take advantage of certain proper-
ties of logarithms and decibels.
 Both ordinary graph paper and semilogarithmic paper are available. 
Semilogarithmic graph paper has a linear scale on the vertical axis and a loga-
rithmic scale on the horizontal axis. People use semilogarithmic paper when they 
want to graph a quantity like voltage gain over many decades of frequency.
Graph of Decibel Voltage Gain
Figure 14-11 a shows the frequency response of a typical ac amplifi  er. The graph 
is similar to Fig. 14-9, but this time we are looking at the decibel voltage gain 
versus frequency as it would appear on semilogarithmic paper. A graph like this 
is called a Bode plot . The vertical axis uses a linear scale, and the horizontal axis 
uses a logarithmic scale.
 As shown, the decibel voltage gain is maximum in the midband. At each 
cutoff frequency, the decibel voltage gain is down slightly from the maximum 
value. Below f1, the decibel voltage gain decreases 20 dB per decade. Above f2, the 
decibel voltage gain decreases 20 dB per decade. Decreases of 20 dB per decade 
occur in an amplifi  er where there is one dominant capacitor producing the lower 
cutoff frequency and one dominant bypass capacitor producing the upper cutoff 
frequency, as discussed in Sec. 14-1.GOOD TO KNOW
The main advantage of using 
logarithmic spacing is that a 
larger range of values can be 
shown in one plot without losing 
resolution in the smaller values.

(b)1 2 3 4 7 8 910 5 6Figure 14-10   Linear and logarithmic scales.588 Chapter 14 At the cutoff frequencies f1 and f2, the voltage gain is 0.707 of the mid-
band value. In terms of decibels:
Av(dB) 5 20 log 0.707 5 23 dB
We can describe the frequency response of Fig. 14-11 a in this way: In the mid-
band, the voltage gain is maximum. Between the midband and each cutoff fre-
quency, the voltage gain gradually decreases until it is down 3 dB at the cutoff 
frequency. Then, the voltage gain rolls off (decreases) at a rate of 20 dB per 
decade.
Ideal Bode Plot
Figure 14-11 b shows the frequency response in ideal  form. Many people prefer 
using the ideal Bode plot because it is easy to draw and gives approximately the 
same information. Anyone looking at this ideal graph knows that the decibel volt-
age gain is down 3 dB at the cutoff frequencies. The ideal Bode plot contains all 
the original information when this correction of 3 dB is mentally included.
 Ideal Bode plots are approximations that allow us to draw the frequency 
response of an amplifi  er quickly and easily. They let us concentrate on the main 
issues rather than being caught in the details of exact calculations. For instance, an 
ideal Bode plot like Fig. 14-12 gives us a quick visual summary of an amplifi  er’s 
frequency response. We can see the midband voltage gain (40 dB), the cutoff fre-
quencies (1 kHz and 100 kHz), and roll-off rate (20 dB per decade). Also, notice 
that the voltage gain equals 0 dB (unity or 1) at f 5 10 Hz and f 5 10 MHz. Ideal 
graphs like these are very popular in industry.
 Incidentally, many technicians and engineers use the term corner fre-
quency  instead of cutoff frequency.  This is because the ideal Bode plot has a sharp 
corner at each cutoff frequency. Another term often used is break frequency.  This 
is because the graph breaks at each cutoff frequency and then decreases at a rate 
of 20 dB per decade.(a)Av(dB)

The data sheet for a 741C op amp gives a midband voltage gain of 100,000, a cutoff frequency of 10 Hz, and roll-off rate of 
20 dB per decade. Draw the ideal Bode plot. What is the ordinary voltage gain at 1 MHz?
SOLUTION  As mentioned in Sec. 14-1, op amps are dc amplifi  ers, so they have only an upper cutoff frequency. For a 
741C, f2 5 10 Hz. The midband voltage gain in decibels is:
Av(dB) 5 20 log 100,000 5 100 dB
The ideal Bode plot has a midband voltage gain of 100 dB up to 10 Hz. Then, it decreases 20 dB per decade.
 Figure 14-13 shows the ideal Bode plot. After breaking at 10 Hz, the response rolls off 20 dB per decade until it 
equals 0 dB at 1 MHz. The ordinary voltage is unity (1) at this frequency. Data sheets often list the unity-gain frequency  
(symbolized funity) because it immediately tells you the frequency limitation of the op amp. The device can provide voltage 
gain up to unity-gain frequency, but not beyond it.

Ideal Bode plots are useful approximations for preliminary analysis. But some-
times, we need more accurate answers. For instance, the voltage gain of an op amp 
gradually decreases between the midband and the cutoff frequency. Let us look at 
this transition region more closely.
Between Midband and Cutoff  
In Sec. 14-1, we introduced the following equation for the voltage gain of an am-
plifi  er above midband:
Av 5   Av(mid) __________  
 Ï— 1 1 (f/f2)2      (14-20)
With this equation, we can calculate the voltage gain in the transition region between 
midband and cutoff. For instance, here are the calculations for f/f2 5 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3:
Av 5   Av(mid) _______________  
 Ï— 1 1 (0.1)2     5 0.995 Av(mid)
Av 5   Av(mid) _______________  
 Ï— 1 1 (0.2)2     5 0.981 Av(mid)
Av 5   Av(mid) _________  
 Ï— 1 1 (0.3)2     5 0.958 Av(mid)
Continuing like this, we can calculate the remaining values shown in Summary 
Table 14-6.
 Summary Table 14-6 includes the dB values for Av/Av(mid). The decibel 
entries are calculated as follows:
(Av/Av(mid))dB 5 20 log 0.995 5 20.04 dB
(Av/Av(mid))dB 5 20 log 0.981 5 20.17 dB

we may want to refer to this table for an accurate value of voltage gain in the re-
gion between midband and cutoff.
Lag Circuit
Most op amps include an RC lag circuit that rolls off the voltage gain at a rate of 
20 dB per decade. This prevents oscillations,  unwanted signals that can appear 
under certain conditions. Later chapters will explain oscillations and how the in-
ternal lag circuit of an op amp prevents these unwanted signals.
 Figure 14-14 shows a circuit with bypass capacitor. R represents the 
Thevenized resistance facing the capacitor. This circuit is often called a lag cir-
cuit because the output voltage lags the input voltage at higher frequencies. Stated 
another way: If the input voltage has a phase angle of 0°, the output voltage has a 
phase angle between 0° and 290°.
 At low frequencies, the capacitive reactance approaches infi  nity, and the 
output voltage equals the input voltage. As the frequency increases, the capacitive 
reactance decreases, which decreases the output voltage. Recall from basic courses 
in electricity that the output voltage for this circuit is:
vout 5   XC __________  
 Ï— R2 1 XC2     vin
If we rearrange the foregoing equation, the voltage gain of Fig. 14-14 is:
Av 5   XC ___________  
 Ï— R2 1 XC 2     (14-21)
Because the circuit has only passive devices, the voltage gain is always less than 
or equal to 1.
 The cutoff frequency of a lag circuit is where the voltage gain is 0.707. 
The equation for cutoff frequency is:
f2 5   1 ______ 2pRC   (14-22)
At this frequency, XC 5 R and the voltage gain is 0.707.
Bode Plot of Voltage Gain
By substituting XC 5 1/2/H9266fC into Eq. (14-21) and rearranging, we can derive this 
equation:
Av 5   1 __________  
 Ï— 1 1(f/f2)2     (14-23)
This equation is similar to Eq. (14-20), where Av(mid) equals 1. For example, when 
f/f2 5 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, we get:
Av 5   1 ___________  
 Ï— 1 1 (0.1)2     5 0.995
Av 5   1 ___________  
 Ï— 1 1 (0.2)2     5 0.981
Av 5   1 ___________  
 Ï— 1 1 (0.3)2     5 0.958
Continuing like this and converting to decibels, we get the values shown in 
Summary T able 14-7.R
C vout vinFigure 14-14   An RC bypass circuit.592 Chapter 14 Figure 14-15 shows the ideal Bode plot of a lag circuit. In the midband, 
the decibel voltage gain is 0 dB. The response breaks at f2 and then rolls off at a 
rate of 20 dB per decade.
6 dB per Octave
Above the cutoff frequency, the decibel voltage gain of a lag circuit decreases 20 
dB per decade. This is equivalent to 6 dB per octave, which is easily proved as 
follows: When f/f2 5 10, 20, and 40, the voltage gain is:
Av 5   1 __________  
 Ï— 1 1 (10)2     5 0.1
Av 5   1 __________  
 Ï— 1 1 (20)2     5 0.05
Av 5   1 __________  
 Ï— 1 1 (40)2     5 0.025
The corresponding decibel voltage gains are:
Av(dB) 5 20 log 0.1 5 220 dB
Av(dB) 5 20 log 0.05 5 226 dB
Av(dB) 5 20 log 0.025 5 232 dB
In other words, you can describe the frequency response of a lag circuit above the 
cutoff frequency in either of two ways: You can say that the decibel voltage gain 
decreases at a rate of 20 dB per decade, or you can say that it decreases at a rate 
of 6 dB per octave.Summary Table 14-7 Response of Lag Circuit

The charging and discharging of a capacitor produces a lag in the output voltage 
of an RC bypass circuit. In other words, the output voltage will lag the input volt-
age by a phase angle /H9278. Figure 14-16 shows how /H9278 varies with frequency. At zero 
hertz (0 Hz), the phase angle is 0°. As the frequency increases, the phase angle of 
the output voltage changes gradually from 0° to 290°. At very high frequencies, 
/H9278 5 290°.
 When necessary, we can calculate the phase angle with this equation 
from basic courses:
f 5 2arctan   R ___ XC   (14-24)
By substituting XC 5 1/2/H9266fC into Eq. (14-24) and rearranging, we can derive this 
equation:
f 5 2arctan   f __ f2   (14-25)
With a calculator that has the tangent function and an inverse key, we can easily 
calculate the phase angle for any value of f/f2. Summary Table 14-8 shows a few 
values for /H9278. For example, when f/f2 5 0.1, 1, and 10, the phase angles are:
/H9278 5 2arctan 0.1 5 25.71°
/H9278 5 2arctan 1 5 245°
/H9278 5 2arctan 10 5 284.3°
Bode Plot of Phase Angle
Figure 14-17 shows how the phase angle of a lag circuit varies with the frequency. 
At very low frequencies, the phase angle is zero. When f 5 0.1f2, the phase angle 
is approximately 26°. When f 5 f2, the phase angle equals 245°. When f 5 10f2, 
the phase angle is approximately 284°. Further increases in frequency produce 
little change because the limiting value is 290°. As you can see, the phase angle 
of a lag circuit is between 0° and 290°.
 A graph like Fig. 14-17 a is a Bode plot of the phase angle. Knowing

the phase angle is approximately 290°.φ

Figure 14-20 a shows an inverting amplifi  er with a voltage gain of Av. Recall that 
an inverting amplifi  er produces an output voltage that is 180° out of phase with 
the input voltage.
SOLUTION   The Thevenin resistance and the bypass capacitor are a lag 
 circuit with a cutoff frequency of:
f2 5   1 ——   2/H9266(2 kV)(500 pF)   5 159 kHz
The amplifi  er has a midband voltage gain of 100, which is equivalent to 40 dB.
 Figure 14-19 b shows the ideal Bode plot. The decibel voltage gain is 40 
dB from zero to the cutoff frequency of 159 kHz. The response then rolls off at a 
rate of 20 dB per decade until it reaches an funity of 15.9 MHz.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 14-15   Repeat Example 14-15 using a Thevenin 
resistance of 1 k V.
Example 14-16
Suppose the amplifi  er stage of Fig. 14-19 a has an internal lag circuit with a  cutoff 
frequency of 1.59 MHz. What effect will this have on the ideal Bode plot?
SOLUTION   Figure 14-19 c shows the frequency response. The response 
breaks at 159 kHz, the cutoff frequency produced by the external 500-pF capacitor. 
The voltage gain rolls off at 20 dB per decade until the frequency is 1.59 MHz. 
At this point, the response breaks again because this is the cutoff frequency of the 
internal lag circuit. The gain then rolls off at a rate of 40 dB per decade.

In Fig. 14-20 a, the capacitor between the input and output terminals is called a 
feedback capacitor  because the amplifi  ed output signal is being fed back to the 
input. A circuit like this is diffi  cult to analyze because the feedback capacitor 
affects the input and output circuits simultaneously.
Converting the Feedback Capacitor
Fortunately, there is a shortcut called Miller’s theorem  that converts the capacitor 
into two separate capacitors, as shown in Fig. 14-20 b. This equivalent circuit is 
easier to work with because the feedback capacitor has been split into two new 
 capacitances Cin(M) and Cout(M) . With complex algebra, it is possible to derive the 
following equations:
Cin(M) 5 C(Av 1 1) (14-26)
Cout(M)  5 C  (   Av 1 1 ______  Av   )  (14-27)
 Miller’s theorem converts the feedback capacitor into two equivalent 
 capacitors, one for the input side and the other for the output side. This makes 
two simple problems out of one big one. Equations (14-26) and (14-27) are valid 
for any inverting amplifi  er such as a CE amplifi  er, a swamped CE amplifi  er, or an 
inverting op amp. In these equations, Av is the midband voltage gain.
 Usually, Av is much greater than 1, and Cout(M)  is approximately equal to 
the feedback capacitance. The striking thing about Miller’s theorem is the  effect 
it has on the input capacitance Cin(M). It’s as though the feedback capacitance has 
been amplifi  ed to get a new capacitance that is Av 1 1 times larger. This phe-
nomenon, known as the Miller effect,  has useful applications because it creates 
artifi  cial or virtual capacitors that are much larger than the feedback capacitor.
Compensating an Op Amp
As discussed in Sec. 14-7, most op amps are internally compensated,  which means 
that they include one dominant bypass capacitor that rolls off the voltage gain at a 
rate of 20 dB per decade. The Miller effect is used to produce this dominant bypass 
capacitor.

(b)Figure 14-21   Miller eff  ect produces an input lag circuit.598 Chapter 14 Here is the basic idea: One of the amplifi  er stages in an op amp has 
a  feedback capacitor as shown in Fig. 14-21 a. With Miller’s theorem, we can 
 convert this feedback capacitor into the two equivalent capacitors shown in 
Fig. 14-21 b. Now, there are two lag circuits, one on the input side and one on the 
output side. Because of the Miller effect, the bypass capacitor on the input side 
is much larger than the bypass capacitor on the output side. As a result, the input 
lag circuit is dominant; that is, it determines the cutoff frequency of the stage. The 
output bypass capacitor usually has no effect until the input frequency is several 
decades higher. 
 In a typical op amp, the input lag circuit of Fig. 14-21 b produces a dom-
inant cutoff frequency. The voltage gain breaks at this cutoff frequency and then 
rolls off at a rate of 20 dB per decade until the input frequency reaches the uni-
ty-gain frequency.

(c)Figure 14-22   Ampliﬁ  er with feedback capacitor and its Bode plot.Frequency Effects 59914-9   Risetime-Bandwidth 
Relationship
Sine-wave testing of an amplifi  er means that we use a sinusoidal input voltage and 
measure the sinusoidal output voltage. To fi  nd the upper cutoff frequency, we have 
to vary the input frequency until the voltage gain drops 3 dB from the midband 
value. Sine-wave testing is one approach. But there is a faster and simpler way to 
test an amplifi  er by using a square wave instead of a sine wave.
Risetime
The capacitor is initially uncharged in Fig. 14-23 a. If we close the switch, the 
 capacitor voltage will rise exponentially toward the supply voltage V. The  risetime 
TR is the time it takes the capacitor voltage to go from 0.1 V (called the 10 percent 
point ) to 0.9 V (called the 90 percent point ). If it takes 10 /H9262s for the  exponential 
waveform to go from the 10 percent point to the 90 percent point, the waveform 
has a risetime of:
TR 5 10 /H9262s
 Instead of using a switch to apply the sudden step in voltage, we can use 
a square-wave generator. For instance, Fig. 14-23 b shows the leading edge of a 
square wave driving the same RC circuit as before. The risetime is still the time it 
takes for the voltage to go from the 10 percent point to the 90 percent point.
 Figure 14-23 c shows how several cycles will look. Although the input 
voltage changes almost instantly from one voltage level to another, the output 
voltage takes much longer to make its transitions because of the bypass capacitor. 
The output voltage cannot suddenly step, because the capacitor has to charge and 
discharge through the resistance.
Relationship between TR and RC
By analyzing the exponential charge of a capacitor, it is possible to derive this 
equation for the risetime:
TR 5 2.2RC (14-28)
SOLUTION   Start by converting the feedback capacitor to its Miller compo-
nents. Since the voltage gain is much greater than 1:
Cin(M) 5 100,000(30 pF) 5 3 /H9262F
Cout(M)  5 30 pF
Figure 14-22 b shows the input and output Miller capacitances. The dominant 
lag circuit on the input side has a cutoff frequency of:
f2 5   1 ______ 2/H9266RC   5   1 _______________   2/H9266(5.3 k V)(3 /H9262F)   5 10 Hz
Since a voltage gain of 100,000 is equivalent to 100 dB, we can draw the ideal 
Bode plot shown in Fig. 14-22 c.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 14-17   Using Fig. 14-22 a, determine Cin(M) and 
Cout(M)  if the voltage gain is 10,000.600 Chapter 14This says that the risetime is slightly more than two RC time constants. For 
 instance, if R equals 10 k V and C is 50 pF, then:
RC 5 (10 k V)(50 pF) 5 0.5 /H9262s
The risetime of the output waveform equals:
TR 5 2.2RC 5 2.2(0.5 /H9262s) 5 1.1 /H9262s
Data sheets often specify the risetime because it is useful to know the response to 
a voltage step when analyzing switching circuits.
An Important Relationship
As mentioned earlier, a dc amplifi  er typically has one dominant lag circuit that 
rolls off the voltage gain at a rate of 20 dB per decade until funity is reached. The 
cutoff frequency of this lag circuit is given by:
f2 5   1 ______ 2/H9266RC  
which can be solved for RC to get:
RC 5   1 ____ 2/H9266f2  
When we substitute this into Eq. (14-28) and simplify, we get this widely used 
equation:

(c) square-wave testing.Frequency Effects 601 This is an important result because it converts risetime to cutoff fre-
quency. It means that we can test an amplifi  er with a square wave to fi  nd the cutoff 
 frequency. Since square-wave testing is much faster than sine-wave testing, many 
engineers and technicians use Eq. (14-29) to fi  nd the upper cutoff frequency of an 
amplifi  er.
 Equation (14-29) is called the risetime-bandwidth relationship.  In a dc 
amplifi  er, the word bandwidth  refers to all the frequencies from zero up to the 
cutoff frequency. Often, bandwidth is used as a synonym for cutoff frequency.  If 
the data sheet for a dc amplifi  er gives a bandwidth of 100 kHz, it means that the 
upper cutoff frequency equals 100 kHz.
Example 14-18
What is the upper cutoff frequency for the circuit shown in Fig. 14-24 a?
SOLUTION   In Fig. 14-24 a, the risetime is 1 /H9262s. With Eq. (14-29):
f2 5   0.35 ____ 1 /H9262s   5 350 kHz
Therefore, the circuit of Fig. 14-24 a has an upper cutoff frequency of 350 kHz. 
An equivalent statement is that the circuit has a bandwidth of 350 kHz.
 Figure 14-24 b illustrates the meaning of sine-wave testing. If we change 
the input voltage from a square wave to a sine wave, we will get a sine-wave 
 output. By increasing the input frequency, we can eventually fi  nd the cutoff 
 frequency of 350 kHz. In other words, we would get the same result with sine-
wave testing, except that it is slower than square-wave testing.

of BJT Stages
A wide variety of op amps is now commercially available with unity-gain fre-
quencies from 1 to over 200 MHz. Because of this, most amplifi  ers are now built 
using op amps. Since op amps are the heart of analog systems, the analysis of dis-
crete amplifi  er stages is less important than it once was. The next section briefl  y 
discusses the low- and high-cutoff frequencies of a voltage-divider biased CE 
stage. We will look at the effects of individual components on the circuit’s fre-
quency response, starting with the low-frequency cutoff point.
Input-Coupling Capacitor
When an ac signal is coupled into an amplifi  er stage, the equivalent looks like 
Fig. 14-25 a. Facing the capacitor is the generator resistance and the input resist-
ance of the stage. This coupling circuit has a cutoff frequency of:
f1 5   1 ______ 2pRC   (14-30)
where R is the sum of RG and Rin. Figure 14-25 b shows the frequency response.
Output-Coupling Capacitor
Figure 14-26 a shows the output side of a BJT stage. After applying Thevenin’s 
theorem, we get the equivalent circuit of Fig. 14-26 b. Equation (14-30) can be 
used to calculate the cutoff frequency, where R is the sum of RC and RL.

 The input-coupling, output-coupling, and emitter-bypass capacitors each 
produce a cutoff frequency. Usually, one of these is dominant. When the frequency 
decreases, the gain breaks at this dominant cutoff frequency. Then, it rolls off at a 
rate of 20 dB per decade until it breaks again at the next cutoff frequency. It then 
rolls off at 40 dB per decade until it breaks a third time. With further decreases in 
frequency, the voltage gain rolls off at 60 dB per decade.vgRGCin

The high-frequency response of an amplifi  er involves a signifi  cant amount of 
 detail and requires accurate values to get good results. We will use some detail in 
our discussion, but more accurate results can be obtained with circuit simulation 
software.
 Figure 14-29 a shows a CE stage with stray-wiring capacitance Cstray. 
Just to the left is Cc9, a quantity usually specifi  ed on the data sheet of a transistor. 
This is the internal capacitance between the collector and the base. Although Cc9
and Cstray are very small, they will have an effect when the input frequency is high 
enough.
 Figure 14-29 b is the ac-equivalent circuit, and Fig. 14-29 c is the 
 Thevenin-equivalent circuit. The cutoff frequency of this lag circuit is:
f2 5   1 ______ 2pRC   (14-32)
 Using Eq. (14-30), the input-coupling circuit has a cutoff frequency of:
 f1 5   1 ______ 2/H9266RC   5   1 ____________________   (2/H9266)(1.78 k V)(0.47 /H9262F)   5 190 Hz
Next, the Thevenin resistance facing the output-coupling capacitor is:
 R  5 RC 1 RL 5 3.6 k V 1 10 k V 5 13.6 k V
The output-coupling circuit will have a cutoff frequency of:
 f1 5   1 ______ 2/H9266RC   5   1 ___________________   (2/H9266)(13.6 k V)(2.2  /H9262F)   5 5.32 Hz
Now, the Thevenin resistance facing the emitter-bypass capacitor is found by:

 zout 5 1 kVi(22.7 V 1 3.0 V)

Therefore, the cutoff frequency for the bypass circuit is:

The results show that:
 f 1 5 190 Hz  input-coupling capacitor
 f 1 5 5.32 Hz output-coupling capacitor
 f 1 5 635 Hz  emitter-bypass capacitor
As you can see by the results, the emitter-bypass circuit becomes the dominant lower-frequency cutoff value.
 The measured midpoint voltage gain Av(mid) in the Bode plot of Fig. 14-28 b is 37.1 dB. The Bode plot shows an 
approximate 3-dB drop at a  frequency of 659 Hz. This is close to our calculation.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 14-19   Using Fig. 14-28 a, change the input-coupling capacitor to 10 /H9262F and the emitter- 
bypass capacitor to 100 mF. Determine the new dominant cutoff frequency.606 Chapter 14where R 5 RCiRL and C 5 Cc9 1 Cstray. It is important to keep wires as short as 
possible in high-frequency work because the stray-wiring capacitance degrades 
bandwidth by lowering the cutoff frequency.
Base Bypass Circuit
The transistor has two internal capacitances Cc9 and Ce9, as shown in Fig. 14-30. 
Since Cc9 is a feedback capacitor, it can be converted into two components. The 
input Miller component then appears in parallel with Ce9. The cutoff frequency of 
this base bypass circuit is given by Eq. (14-32), where R is the Thevenin resist-
ance facing the capacitance. The capacitance is the sum of Ce9 and the input Miller 
component.
 The collector bypass capacitor and Miller input capacitance each produce 
a cutoff frequency. Normally, one of these is dominant. When the frequency in-
creases, the gain breaks at this dominant cutoff frequency. Then, it rolls off at a CR

further decreases in frequency, the voltage gain rolls off at 40 dB per decade.
 On data sheets, CC9 may be listed as Cbc, Cob, or Cobo. This value is speci-
fi ed at a particular transistor operating condition. As an example, the Cobo value for 
a 2N3904 is specifi  ed as 4.0 pF when VCB 5 5.0 V , IE 5 0, and frequency is 1 MHz. 
Ce9 is often listed as Cbe, Cib, or Cibo on data sheets. The data sheet for a 2N3904 
specifi  es a Cibo value of 8 pF when VEB 5 0.5 V , IC 5 0, and frequency is 1 MHz. 
These values are shown in Fig. 14-31 a under Small-Signal Characteristics.
 Each of these internal capacitance values will vary, depending on the 
 circuit condition. Figure 14-31 b shows how Cobo changes as the amount of reverse 
bias VCB changes. Also, Cbe is dependent on the transistor’s operating point. When 
not given on a data sheet, Cbe can be approximated by:

Using the circuit values shown in Fig. 14-28 a, calculate the high-frequency cutoff 
values for the base bypass circuit and the collector bypass circuit. Use 150 for beta 
and 10 pF for the stray output capacitance. Compare the results to a Bode plot using 
simulation software.
SOLUTION   First determine the values of transistor input and output capacitance.
 In our previous dc calculations of this circuit, we determined that VB 5 
1.8 V and VC 5 6.04 V . This results in a collector-to-base reverse voltage of 
 approximately 4.2 V . Using the graph of Fig. 14-31 b, the value of Cobo or C9e at 
this reverse voltage is 2.1 pF. The value of C9e can be found using Eq. (14-33) as:
C9e 5   1 ____________________   (2/H9266)(300 MHz)(22.7  V)   5 23.4 pF
Since the voltage gain for this amplifi  er circuit is:
Av 5   rc __ r9e   5   2.65 k V _______ 22.7 V   5 117
The input Miller capacitance is found by:

Now, using Eq. (14-32), the base bypass circuit cutoff frequency is:
f2 5   1 _________________   (2/H9266)(397  V)(271 pF)   5 1.48 MHz
The collector bypass circuit cutoff frequency is found by fi  rst determining the total 
output bypass capacitance:
C 5 C9C 1 Cstray
Using Eq. (14-27), the output Miller capacitance is found by:
Cout(M)  5 CC  (   Av 1 1 ______  Av   )  5 2.1 pF  (   117 1 1 _______  117   )  > 2.1 pF
The total output bypass capacitance is:
C 5 2.1 pF 1 10 pF 5 12.1 pF
The resistance facing this capacitance is:
R 5 RC i RL 5 3.6 k V i 10 k V 5 2.65 k VFrequency Effects 609
Therefore, the collector bypass circuit cutoff frequency is:
f2 5   1 ____________________   (2/H9266)(2.65 k V)(12.1 pF)   5 4.96 MHz
The dominant cutoff frequency is determined by the lower of the two cutoff fre-
quencies. In Fig. 14-28 a, the Bode plot using Multisim shows a high-frequency 
cutoff of approximately 1.5 MHz.

 Example 14-20 is 40 pF, determine the collector bypass cutoff frequency.
14-11   Frequency Analysis 
of FET Stages
The frequency response analysis of FET circuits is similar to that of BJT circuits. In 
most cases, the FET will have an input-coupling circuit and an output-coupling cir-
cuit, one of which will determine the low-frequency cutoff point. The gate and drain 
will have an unwanted bypass circuit mainly as the result of the FET’s  internal capac-
itances. Along with stray-wiring capacitance, this will determine the high- frequency 
cutoff point.
Low-Frequency Analysis
Figure 14-32 shows an E-MOSFET common-source amplifi  er circuit using volt-
age-divider bias. Because of the very high input resistance of the MOSFET, the 
resistance R facing the input-coupling capacitor is:
R 5 RG 1 R1 i R2 (14-36)
and the input-coupling cutoff frequency is found by:
f1 5   1 ______ 2/H9266RC  
The output resistance facing the output-coupling capacitor is:
R 5 RD 1 RL
and the output-coupling cutoff frequency is found by:
f1 5   1 ______ 2/H9266RC  
 As you can see, the low-frequency analysis of the FET circuit is similar 
to the BJT circuit. Because of the very high input resistance of the FET, larger 
voltage-divider-resistor values can be used. This results in being able to use a much 
smaller input-coupling capacitor.610 Chapter 14

Like the high-frequency analysis of a BJT circuit, determining the high-frequency 
cutoff point of a FET involves a signifi  cant amount of detail and requires the use 
of accurate values. As with the BJT, FETs have internal capacitances Cgs, Cgd, and 
Cds as shown in Fig. 14-33 a. These capacitance values are not important at low 
 frequencies, but become signifi  cant at high frequencies.
Because these capacitances are diffi  cult to measure, manufacturers meas-
ure and list the FET capacitances under short-circuit conditions. For example, Ciss
is the input capacitance with an ac short across the output. When doing this, Cgd
 becomes in parallel with Cgs (Fig. 14-33 b) so Ciss is found by:
Ciss 5 Cds 1 Cgd

Application Example 14-21
Using the circuit shown in Fig. 14-32, determine the input-coupling circuit and 
output-coupling circuit low-frequency cutoff points. Compare the calculated  values 
to a Bode plot using Multisim.
SOLUTION   The Thevenin resistance facing the input-coupling capacitor is:
R 5 600 V 1 2 MVi1 MV 5 667 k V
and the input-coupling cutoff frequency is:
f1 5   1 ——   (2/H9266)(667 k V)(0.1 /H9262F)   5 2.39 Hz 
Next, the Thevenin resistance facing the output-coupling capacitor is found by:
R 5 150 V 1 1 kV 5 1.15 k V
and the output-coupling cutoff frequency is:
f1 5   1 ___________________   (2/H9266)(1.15 k V)(10  /H9262F)   5 13.8 Hz
Therefore, the dominant low-frequency cutoff value is 13.8 Hz. The midpoint volt-
age gain of this circuit is 22.2 dB. The Bode plot in Fig. 14-32 b shows a 3-dB loss 
at approximately 14 Hz. This is very close to the calculated value.612 Chapter 14Data sheets often list Coss, the capacitance looking back into the FET with 
a short across the input terminals (Fig. 14-33 c), as:
Coss 5 Cds 1 Cgd
Data sheets also commonly list the feedback capacitance Crss. The feed-
back capacitance is equal to:
Crss 5 Cgd
By using these equations, we can determine that:
Cgd 5 Crss (14-37)
Cgs 5 Ciss 2 Crss (14-38)
Cds 5 Coss 2 Crss (14-39)
The gate-to-drain capacitance Cgd is used to determine the input Miller capacitance 
Cin(M) and the output Miller capacitance Cout(M) . These values are found by:
Cin(M) 5 Cgd (Av 1 1) (14-40)
and
Cout(M)  5 Cgd  (   Av 1 1 ______  Av   )  (14-41)
where Av 5 gmrd for the common-source amplifi  er.
Application Example 14-22
In the MOSFET amplifi  er circuit of Fig. 14-32, the 2N7000 has these capacitances 
given on a data sheet:
Ciss 5 60 pF
Coss 5 25 pF
Crss 5 5.0 pF
If gm 5 97 mS, what are the high-frequency cutoff values for the gate and drain 
circuits? Compare the calculations to a Bode plot.
SOLUTION   Using the given data sheet capacitance values, we can determine 
the FET’s internal capacitances by:
Cgd 5 Crss 5 5.0 pF
Cgs 5 Ciss 2 Crss 5 60 pF 2 5 pF 5 55 pF
Cds 5 Coss 2 Crss 5 25 pF 2 5 pF 5 20 pF
 To determine the Miller input capacitance, we must fi  rst fi nd the voltage 
gain of the amplifi  er. This is found by:
Av 5 gmrd 5 (93 mS)(150 V i 1 kV) 5 12.1
Therefore, Cin(M) is:
Cin(M) 5 Cgd (Av 11) 5 5.0 pF (12.1 1 1) 5 65.5 pF
The gate-bypass capacitance is found by:
C 5 Cgs 1 Cin(M) 5 55 pF 1 65.5 pF 5 120.5 pFFrequency Effects 613Summary Table 14-9 shows some of the equations used for frequency analysis of 
a common-emitter BJT amplifi  er stage and a common-source FET amplifi  er stage.
Conclusion
We have examined some of the issues involved in the frequency analysis of dis-
crete BJT and FET amplifi  er stages. If done manually, the analysis can be tedious 
and time consuming. The discussion was deliberately kept somewhat brief here 
because the frequency analysis of discrete amplifi  ers is now mainly done on a 
computer. We hope you can see how some of the individual components shape the 
frequency response.
 If you need to analyze a discrete amplifi  er stage, use Multisim or an 
equivalent circuit simulator. Multisim loads all the parameters of the BJT or FET, 
quantities like C9C, C9e, Crss, and Coss, as well as the midband quantities like ß, r9e, 
and gm. In other words, Multisim contains built-in data sheets of devices. For 
instance, when you select a 2N3904, Multisim will load all the parameters (in-
cluding at high frequencies) for a 2N3904. This is a tremendous time saver.
 Furthermore, you can use the Bode plotter in Multisim to see the fre-
quency response. With a Bode plotter, you can measure the midband voltage gain 
and the cutoff frequencies. In short, using Multisim or other circuit simulation 
software is the fastest and most accurate way to analyze the frequency response of 
a discrete BJT or FET amplifi  er.
The resistance facing C is:
R 5 RG i R1 i R2 5 600 V i 2 MV i 1 MV > 600 V
The gate-bypass cutoff frequency is:
f2 5   1 ___________________   (2/H9266)(600  V)(120.5 pF)   5 2.2 MHz
Next, the drain-bypass capacitance is found by:
C 5 Cds 1 Cout(M)
C 5 20 pF 1 5.0 pF  (   12.1 1 1 ________  12.1   )  5 25.4 pF
The resistance rd facing this capacitance is:
rd 5 RD i RL 5 150 V i 1 kV 5 130 V
The drain-bypass cutoff frequency is therefore:
f2 5   1 __________________   (2/H9266)(130  V)(25.4 pF)   5 48 MHz
As shown in Fig. 14-32 c, the high-frequency cutoff frequency measured using 
Multisim is approximately 48 MHz. As you can see, this measurement matches our 
calculations. This example demonstrates the importance of choosing the correct 
internal capacitance values of the device, which are critical to the calculations.

14-12   Frequency Eff  ects of Surface-
Mount Circuits
Stray capacitance and inductance become serious considerations for discrete and 
IC devices that are operating above 100 kHz. With conventional feed-through 
components, there are three sources of stray effects:
1. The geometry and internal structure of the device.
2. The printed-circuit layout, including the orientation of the devices and 
the conductive tracks.
3. The external leads on the device.
Using SM components virtually eliminates item 3 from the list, thus increasing 
the amount of control design engineers have over stray effects among components 
on a circuit board.
Summary
SEC. 14-1  FREQUENCY 
RESPONSE OF 
AN AMPLIFIER
The frequency response is the graph 
of voltage gain versus input fre-
quency. An ac ampliﬁ  er has a lower 
and an upper cutoff   frequency. A dc 
ampliﬁ  er has only an upper cutoff   
frequency. Coupling and bypass 
capacitors produce the lower cutoff   
frequency. Internal transistor capaci-
tances and stray-wiring capacitances 
produce the upper cutoff   frequency.
SEC. 14-2  DECIBEL POWER 
GAIN
Decibel power gain is deﬁ  ned as 
10 times the common logarithm of 
the power gain. When the power 
gain increases by a factor of 2, the 
decibel power gain increases by 
3 dB. When the power gain increases 
by a factor of 10, the decibel power 
gain increases by 10  dB.
SEC. 14-3  DECIBEL VOLTAGE 
GAIN
Decibel voltage gain is deﬁ  ned as 
20 times the common logarithm of 
the voltage gain. When the voltage 
gain increases by a factor of 2, the 
decibel voltage gain increases by 6  dB. When the voltage gain increases 
by a factor of 10, the decibel voltage 
gain increases by 20  dB. The total 
decibel voltage gain of cascaded 
stages equals the sum of the individ-
ual decibel voltage gains.
SEC. 14-4  IMPEDANCE 
MATCHING
In many systems, all impedances 
are matched because this produces 
maximum power transfer. In an 
impedance-matched system, the 
decibel power gain and the decibel 
voltage gain are equal.
SEC. 14-5  DECIBELS ABOVE A 
REFERENCE
Besides using decibels with power 
and voltage gains, we can use deci-
bels above a reference. Two popular 
references are the milliwatt and the 
volt. Decibels with the 1-milliwatt 
reference are labeled dBm, and 
decibels with the 1-volt reference are 
labeled dBV.
SEC. 14-6  BODE PLOTS
An octave refers to a factor of 2 
change in frequency. A decade 
refers to a factor of 10 change in fre-
quency. A graph of decibel voltage gain versus frequency is called a 
Bode plot. Ideal Bode plots are ap-
proximations that allow us to draw 
the frequency response quickly and 
easily.
SEC. 14-7  MORE BODE PLOTS
In a lag circuit, the voltage gain 
breaks at the upper cutoff   frequency 
and then rolls off   at a rate of 20  dB 
per decade, equivalent to 6  dB per 
octave. We can also draw a Bode 
plot of phase angle versus frequency. 
With a lag circuit, the phase angle is 
between 0° and 290°.
SEC. 14-8  THE MILLER EFFECT
A feedback capacitor from the output 
to the input of an inverting ampliﬁ  er is 
equivalent to two capacitors. One ca-
pacitor is across the input terminals, 
and the other is across the output 
terminals. The Miller eff  ect refers to 
the input capacitance being Av 1 1 
times the feedback capacitance.
SEC. 14-9  RISETIME-BANDWIDTH 
RELATIONSHIP
When a voltage step is used as the 
input to a dc ampliﬁ  er, the risetime of 
the output is the time between the 
10 and 90 percent points. The upper 616 Chapter 14cutoff   frequency equals 0.35 divided 
by the risetime. This gives us a quick 
and easy way to measure the band-
width of a dc ampliﬁ  er.
14-10  FREQUENCY ANALYSIS 
OF BJT STAGES
The input-coupling capacitor, 
output-coupling capacitor, and 
emitter-bypass capacitor produce the 
low-cutoff   frequencies. The collector bypass capacitor and the input Miller 
capacitance produce the high-cutoff   
frequencies. Frequency analysis of 
bipolar and FET stages is typically 
done with Multisim or an equivalent 
circuit simulator.
14-11  FREQUENCY ANALYSIS 
OF FET STAGES
The input- and output-coupling 
 capacitors of a FET stage produce the low-cutoff   frequencies (like 
a BJT stage). The drain-bypass 
 capacitances, along with the 
gate capacitance and input Miller 
capacitance, produce the high-cutoff   
frequencies.  Frequency analysis of 
BJT and FET stages is typically done 
with Multisim or an equivalent circuit 
simulator.

The term  operational  ampliﬁ  er (op amp)  refers  to an ampliﬁ  er 
that performs  a mathematical  operation.  Historically,  the ﬁ rst op 
amps  were  used  in analog  computers,  where  they  did addition,  
subtraction,  multiplication,  and so on. At one time,  op amps  were  
built  as discrete  circuits.  Now,  most  op amps  are integrated  
circuits  (ICs).
The typical  op amp  is a dc ampliﬁ  er with very  high  voltage  gain,  
very  high  input  impedance,  and very  low output  impedance.  The 
unity-gain  frequency  is from  1 to more  than  20 MHz,  depending  on 
the part number.  An IC op amp  is a complete  functional  block  with 
external  pins.  By connecting  these  pins to supply  voltages  and a 
few components,  we can quickly  build  all kinds  of useful  circuits.
The input  circuit  used  in most  op amps  is the diff erential  
ampliﬁ  er. This  ampliﬁ  er conﬁ  guration  establishes  many  of the 
IC’s input  characteristics.  The diff erential  ampliﬁ  er may  also  be 
conﬁ  gured  in a discrete  form  to be used  in communications,  
instrumentation,  and industrial  control  circuits.  This  chapter  will 
focus  on the diff erential  ampliﬁ  er used  in ICs.

Transistors, diodes, and resistors are the only practical components in typical ICs. 
Capacitors may also be used, but they are small, usually less than 50 pF. For this 
reason, IC designers cannot use coupling and bypass capacitors the way a discrete 
circuit designer can. Instead, the IC designer has to use direct coupling between 
stages and also needs to eliminate the emitter bypass capacitor without losing too 
much voltage gain.
 The differential  amplifi  er (diff amp)  is the key. The design of this 
circuit is extremely clever because it eliminates the need for an emitter bypass 
 capacitor. For this and other reasons, the diff amp is used as the input stage of 
 almost every IC op amp.
Diff erential  Input  and Output
Figure 15-1 shows a diff amp. It is two CE stages in parallel with a common 
emitter resistor. Although it has two input voltages ( v1 and v2) and two collector 
voltages ( vc1 and vc2), the overall circuit is considered to be one stage. Because 
there are no coupling or bypass capacitors, there is no lower cutoff frequency.
 The ac output voltage vout is defi  ned as the voltage between the collectors 
with the polarity shown in Fig. 15-1:
vout 5 vc2 2 vc1 (15-1)
This voltage is called a differential  output  because it combines the two ac 
 collector voltages into one voltage that equals the difference of the collector volt-
ages. Note:  We will use lowercase letters for vout, vc1, and vc2 because they are ac 
voltages that include zero hertz (0 Hz) as a special case.
 Ideally, the circuit has identical transistors and equal collector resistors. 
With perfect symmetry, vout is zero when the two input voltages are equal. When 
v1 is greater than v2, the output voltage has the polarity shown in Fig. 15-1. When 
v2 is greater than v1, the output voltage is inverted and has the opposite polarity.
 The diff amp of Fig. 15-1 has two separate inputs. Input v1 is called the 
noninverting  input  because vout is in phase with v1. On the other hand, v2 is called 
the inverting  input  because vout is 180° out of phase with v2. In some applica-
tions, only the noninverting input is used and the inverting input is grounded. In 
Figure  15-1  Diff  erential  input  and diff erential  output.

grounded.
 When both the noninverting and inverting input voltages are present, the 
total input is called a differential  input  because the output voltage equals the volt-
age gain times the difference of the two input voltages. The equation for the output 
voltage is:
vout 5 Av(v1 2 v2) (15-2)
where Av is the voltage gain. We will derive the equation for voltage gain in 
Sec. 15-3.
Single-Ended  Output
A differential output like that of Fig. 15-1 requires a fl  oating load because neither 
end of the load can be grounded. This is inconvenient in many applications since 
loads are often single-ended;  that is, one end is grounded.
 Figure 15-2 a shows a widely used form of the diff amp. This has many 
applications because it can drive single-ended loads like CE stages, emitter fol-
lowers, and other circuits. As you can see, the ac output signal is taken from the 
collector on the right side. The collector resistor on the left has been removed 
 because it serves no useful purpose.
 Because the input is differential, the ac output voltage is still given by 
Av(v1 2 v2). With a single-ended output, however, the voltage gain is half as much 
as with a differential output. We get half as much voltage gain with a single-ended 
output because the output is coming from only one of the collectors.
 Incidentally, Fig. 15-2 b shows the block-diagram symbol for a diff amp 
with a differential input and a single-ended output. The same symbol is used for 
Figure  15-2   (a) Diff erential  input  and single-ended  output;  (b) block  diagram

Noninverting-Input  Conﬁ  gurations
Often, only one of the inputs is active and the other is grounded, as shown in 
Fig. 15-3 a. This confi  guration has a noninverting input and a differential output. 
Since v2 5 0, Eq. (15-2) gives:
vout 5 Av(v1) (15-3)
 Figure 15-3 b shows another confi  guration for the diff amp. This one has 
a noninverting input and a single-ended output. Since vout is the ac output voltage, 
Eq. (15-3) is still valid, but the voltage gain Av will be half as much because the 
output is taken from only one side of the diff amp.
Inverting-Input Conﬁ  gurations
In some applications, v2 is the active input and v1 is the grounded input, as shown 
in Fig. 15-4 a. In this case, Eq. (15-2) simplifi  es to:
vout 5 2Av(v2) (15-4)
The minus sign in Eq. (15-4) indicates phase inversion.
 Figure 15-4 b shows the fi  nal confi  guration that we will discuss. Here we 
are using the inverting input with a single-ended output. In this case, the ac output 
voltage is still given by Eq. (15-4).
Conclusion
Summary Table 15-1 summarizes the four basic confi  gurations of a diff amp. 
The general case has a differential input and differential output. The remaining 
cases are subsets of the general case. For instance, to get single-ended input 
operation, one of the inputs is used and the other is grounded. When the input 
is single-ended,  either the noninverting input v1 or the inverting input v2 may 
be used.Figure  15-3   (a) Noninverting  input  and diff erential  output;  (b) noninverting  input  and single-ended  output.

Figure 15-5 a shows the dc-equivalent circuit for a diff amp. Throughout this dis-
cussion, we will assume identical transistors and equal collector resistors. Also, 
both bases are grounded in this preliminary analysis.
 The bias used here should look familiar. It is almost identical to the two-
supply emitter bias (TSEB) discussed in a previous chapter. If you recall, most of 
the negative supply voltage in a TSEB circuit appears across the emitter resistor. 
This sets up a fi  xed emitter current.
Ideal  Analysis
A diff amp is sometimes called a long-tail  pair because the two transistors share 
a common resistor RE. The current through this common resistor is called the tail
current.  If we ignore the VBE drops across the emitter diodes of Fig. 15-5 a, then 
the top of the emitter resistor is ideally a dc ground point. In this case, all of VEE
appears across RE and the tail current is:

it quickly gets to the point, which is that almost all the emitter supply voltage 
 appears across the emitter resistor.
 When the two halves of Fig. 15-5 a are perfectly matched, the tail current 
will split equally. Therefore, each transistor has an emitter current of:
IE 5   IT __ 2   (15-6)
The dc voltage on either collector is given by this familiar equation:
VC 5 VCC 2 ICRC (15-7)
Second  Approximation
We can improve the dc analysis by including the VBE drop across each emitter 
diode. In Fig. 15-5 b, the voltage at the top of the emitter resistor is one VBE drop 
below ground. Therefore, the tail current is:
IT 5   VEE 2 VBE __________  RE   (15-8)
where VBE 5 0.7 V for silicon transistors.
Eff ect of Base  Resistors  on Tail Current
In Fig. 15-5 b, both bases are grounded for simplicity. When base resistors are 
used, they have a negligible effect on the tail current in a well-designed diff amp. 
Here is the reason: When base resistors are included in the analysis, the equation 
for tail current becomes:
IT 5   VEE 2 VBE ____________   RE 1 RB/2/H9252dc  
In any practical design, RB/2/H9252dc is less than 1 percent of RE. This is why we prefer 
using either Eq. (15-5) or Eq. (15-8) to calculate tail current.
 Although base resistors have a negligible effect on the tail current, they 
can produce input error voltages when the two halves of the diff amp are not per-
fectly symmetrical. We will discuss these input error voltages in a later section.Figure  15-5   (a) Ideal  dc analysis;  (b) second  approximation.

Recalculate the currents and voltages for Fig. 15-6 a using the second  approximation.
SOLUTION   The tail current is:

Each emitter current is half of the tail current:
IE 5   1.91 mA ________  2   5 0.955 mA
and each collector has a quiescent voltage of:
VC 5 15 V 2 (0.955 mA)(5 k V) 5 10.2 V
 As you can see, the answers change only slightly when the second approximation is used. In fact, if the same circuit 
is built and tested with Multisim, the following answers result with 2N3904 transistors:
IT 5 1.912 mA
IE 5 0.956 mA
IC 5 0.950 mA
VC 5 10.25 V
These answers are almost the same as the second approximation and are not much different from the ideal answers. The 
point is that ideal analysis is adequate for many situations. If you need more accuracy, use either the second approximation 
or Multisim analysis.

In this section, we will derive the equation for the voltage gain of a diff amp. We 
will start with the simplest confi  guration, the noninverting input and single-ended 
output. After deriving its voltage gain, we will extend the results to the other 
 confi gurations.
Theory  of Operation
Figure 15-8 a shows a noninverting input and single-ended output. With a large RE, 
the tail current is almost constant when a small ac signal is present. Because of 
this, the two halves of a diff amp respond in a complementary manner to the non-
inverting input. In other words, an increase in the emitter current of Q1 produces a 
decrease in the emitter current of Q2. Conversely, a decrease in the emitter current 
of Q1 produces an increase in the emitter current of  Q2.
 In Fig. 15-8 a, the left transistor Q1 acts like an emitter follower that 
produces an ac voltage across the emitter resistor. This ac voltage is half of the 
input voltage v1. On the positive half-cycle of input voltage, the Q1 emitter current 
 increases, the Q2 emitter current decreases, and the Q2 collector voltage increases.

 decreases, the Q2 emitter current increases, and the Q2 collector voltage decreases. 
This is why the amplifi  ed output sine wave is in phase with the noninverting input.
Single-Ended  Output  Gain
Figure 15-8 b shows the ac-equivalent circuit. Notice that each transistor has an re9. 
Also, the biasing resistor RE is in parallel with the re9 of the right transistor because 
the base of Q2 is grounded. In any practical design, RE is much greater than re9. 
Because of this, we can ignore RE in a preliminary analysis.
 Figure 15-8 c shows the simplifi  ed equivalent circuit. Notice that the 
input voltage v1 is across the fi  rst re9 in series with the second re9. Since the two 
 resistances are equal, the voltage across each re9 is half of the input voltage. This is 
why the ac voltage across the tail resistor of Fig. 15-8 a is half of the input voltage.
 In Fig. 15-8 c, the ac output voltage is:
vout 5 icRC
and the ac input voltage is:
vin 5 iere9 1 iere9 5 2iere9
Dividing vout by vin gives the voltage gain:
Single-ended  output:  Av 5   RC ___ 2r9e   (15-9)
 A fi  nal point: In Fig. 15-8 a, a quiescent dc voltage VC exists at the output 
terminal. This voltage is not part of the ac signal. The ac voltage vout is any change 
from the quiescent voltage. In an op amp, the quiescent dc voltage is removed in 
a later stage because it is unimportant.
Diff erential-Output  Gain
Figure 15-9 shows the ac-equivalent circuit for a noninverting input and differen-
tial output. The analysis is almost identical to the previous example, except that 
the output voltage is twice as much since there are two collector resistors:
vout 5 vc2 2 vc1 5 icRC 2 (2icRC) 5 2icRC
(Note:  The second minus sign appears because the vc1 signal is 180° out of phase 
with vc2, as shown in Fig. 15-9.)

Dividing the output voltage by the input voltage gives the voltage gain:
Differential  output:  Av 5   RC ___ r9e   (15-10)
This is easy to remember because it is the same as the voltage gain for a CE stage.
Inverting-Input  Conﬁ  gurations
Figure 15-10 a shows an inverting input and single-ended output. The ac analysis 
is almost identical to the noninverting analysis. In this circuit, the inverting input 
v2 produces an amplifi  ed and inverted ac voltage at the fi  nal output. The re9 of each 
transistor is still part of a voltage divider in the ac-equivalent circuit. This is why 
the ac voltage across RE is half of the inverting input voltage. If a differential out-
put is used, the voltage gain is twice as much as previously discussed.
 The diff amp in Fig. 15-10 b is an upside-down pnp version of Fig. 15-10 a. 
Frequently, pnp transistors are used in transistor circuits using positive power sup-
plies. These pnp transistors are drawn in an upside-down confi  guration. As with 
the npn versions, the inputs and outputs may be either differential or single-ended.
Diff erential-Input  Conﬁ  gurations
The differential-input confi  gurations have both inputs active at the same time. 
The ac analysis can be simplifi  ed by using the superposition theorem as follows: 
Since we know how a diff amp behaves with noninverting and inverting in-
puts, we can combine the two results to get the equations for differential-input 
confi gurations.Figure  15-10   (a) Inverting  input  with single-ended  output;  (b) pnp version.

Table  of Voltage  Gains
Summary Table 15-2 summarizes the voltage gains for the diff-amp confi  gura-
tions. As you can see, the voltage gain is maximum with a differential output. 
The voltage gain is cut in half when a single-ended output is used. Also, when a 
single-ended output is used, the input may be noninverting or inverting.
Input  Impedance
In a CE stage, the input impedance of the base is:
zin 5 /H9252re9
In a diff amp, the input impedance of either base is twice as high:
zin 5 2bre9 (15-11)
The input impedance of a diff amp is twice as high because there are two ac emit-
ter resistances re9 in the ac-equivalent circuit instead of one. Equation (15-11) is 
valid for all confi  gurations because any ac input signal sees two ac emitter resist-
ances in the path between the base and ground.Summary Table 15-2Diff -Amp  Voltage

In Fig. 15-11, what is the ac output voltage? If /H9252 5 300, what is the input 
 impedance of the diff amp?
SOLUTION   We analyzed the dc-equivalent circuit in Example 15-1. Ideally, 
15 V is across the emitter resistor, producing a tail current of 2 mA, which means 
that the dc emitter current in each transistor is:

The Multisim output voltage and the input impedance are both slightly lower than 
our calculated values. When using specifi  c part numbers for transistors, Multisim 
loads in all kinds of higher-order transistor parameters that produce  almost exact 
answers. This is why you must use a computer if you need high  accuracy. Other-
wise, rest satisfi  ed with approximate methods of analysis.

SOLUTION   Instead of driving the noninverting input, we are driv ing the in-

is inverted. The input impedance is approximately 15 k V.

15-4   Input  Characteristics  
of an Op Amp
Assuming perfect symmetry in a diff amp is a good approximation for many 
 applications. But in precision applications, we can no longer treat the two halves 
of a diff amp as identical. There are three characteristics on the data sheet of every 
op amp that a designer uses when more accurate answers are needed. They are the 
input bias current, the input offset current, and the input offset voltage.
Input  Bias  Current
In an integrated op amp, the /H9252dc of each transistor in the fi  rst stage is slightly dif-
ferent, which means that the base currents in Fig. 15-13 are slightly different. The 
input  bias current  is defi  ned as the average of the dc base currents:
Iin(bias)  5   IB1 1 IB2 ________  2   (15-12)
For instance, if IB1 5 90 nA and IB2 5 70 nA, the input bias current is:
Iin(bias)  5   90 nA 1 70 nA  _____________  2   5 80 nA
With bipolar op amps, the input bias current is typically in nanoamperes. When 
op amps use JFETs in the input diff amp, the input bias current is in picoamperes.RE

GOOD  TO KNOW
An op amp  that uses  JFETs  in 
the input  differential  amplifier  
and bipolar  transistors  for the 
following  stages  is called  a 
bi-FET  op amp.Differential Ampliﬁ  ers 641 The input bias current will fl  ow through the resistances between the 
bases and ground. These resistances may be discrete resistances, or they may be 
the Thevenin resistances of the input sources.
Input  Off set Current
The input  offset  current  is defi  ned as the difference of the dc base currents:
Iin(off)  5 IB1 2 IB2 (15-13)
This difference in the base currents indicates how closely the transistors are 
matched. If the transistors are identical, the input offset current is zero because 
both base currents will be equal. But almost always, the two transistors are slightly 
different and the two base currents are not equal.
 As an example, suppose IB1 5 90 nA and IB2 5 70 nA. Then:
Iin(off)  5 90 nA 2 70 nA 5 20 nA
The Q1 transistor has 20 nA more base current than the Q2 transistor. This can 
cause a problem when large base resistances are used.
Base  Currents  and Off sets
By rearranging Eqs. (15-12) and (15-13), we can derive these two equations for 
the base currents:
IB1 5 Iin(bias)  1   Iin(off) _____ 2   (15-13a)
IB2 5 Iin(bias)  2   Iin(off) _____ 2   (15-13b)
Data sheets always list Iin(bias)  and Iin(off) , but not IB1 and IB2. With these equations, 
we can calculate the base currents. These equations assume that IB1 is greater than 
IB2. If IB2 is greater than IB1, transpose the equations.
Eff ect of Base  Current
Some diff amps operate with a base resistance on only one side, as shown in 
Fig. 15-14 a. Because of the base current direction, the base current through RB
produces a noninverting dc input voltage of:
V1 5 2 IB1RBFigure  15-13   Diff  erent  base  currents.
RC RC
REQ1 Q2+VCC
–VEEIB1 IB2642 Chapter 15(Note:  Capital letters are used here and elsewhere for dc error voltages like V1. 
For simplicity, we will treat V1 as an absolute value. This voltage has the same 
effect as a genuine input signal. When this false signal is amplifi  ed, an unwanted 
dc voltage Verror appears across the output, as shown in Fig. 15-14 a.)
 For instance, if a data sheet gives Iin(bias)  5 80 nA and Iin(off)  5 20 nA, 
Eqs. (15-13 a) and (15-13 b) give:
IB1 5 80 nA 1   20 nA ______  2   5 90 nA
IB2 5 80 nA 2   20 nA ______  2   5 70 nA
If RB 5 1 kV, the noninverting input has an error volt  age of:
V1 5 (90 nA)(1 k V) 5 90 /H9262V
Eff ect of Input  Off set Current
One way to reduce the output error voltage is by using an equal base resistance 
on the other side of the diff amp, as shown in Fig. 15-14 b. In this case, we have a 
differential dc input of:
Vin 5 IB1RB 2 IB2RB 5 (IB1 2 IB2)RB
or
Vin 5 Iin(off) RB (15-14)
Since Iin(off)  is usually less than 25 percent of Iin(bias) , the input error voltage is 
much less when equal base resistors are used. For this reason, designers often 
 include an equal base resistance on the opposite side of a diff amp, as shown in 
Fig. 15-14 b.
 For instance, if Iin(bias)  5 80 nA and Iin(off)  5 20 nA, then a base resist-
ance of 1 k V produces an input error voltage of:
Vin 5 (20 nA)(1 k V) 5 20 /H9262VFigure  15-14   (a) Base  resistor  produces  unwanted  input  voltage;  (b) equal  base  resistance  on other  side reduces  error

When a diff amp is integrated as the fi  rst stage of an op amp, the two halves are 
almost, but not quite, identical. To begin with, the two collector resistances may 
be different, as shown in Fig. 15-15 a. Because of this, an error voltage appears 
across the output.
 Another source of error is the different VBE curves for each transistor. 
For instance, suppose that the two base-emitter curves have the same current, 
as shown in Fig. 15-15 b. Because the curves are slightly different, there is a dif-
ference between the two VBE values. This difference adds to the error voltage. 
 Besides RC and VBE, other transistor parameters may differ slightly on each half 
of the diff amp.
 The input  offset  voltage  is defi  ned as the input voltage that would pro-
duce the same output error voltage in a perfect diff amp. As an equation:
Vin(off)  5   Verror _____ Av   (15-15)
In this equation, Verror does not include the effects of input bias and offset current 
because both bases are grounded when Verror is measured.
 For instance, if a diff amp has an output error voltage of 0.6 V and a 
 voltage gain of 300, the input offset voltage is:
Vin(off)  5   0.6 V _____ 300   5 2 mV
Figure 15-15 c illustrates the idea. An input offset voltage of 2 mV is driving a diff 
amp with a voltage gain of 300 to produce an error voltage of 0.6 V .Figure  15-15   (a) Diff erent  collector  resistors  produce  error  when  bases  are grounded;  (b) diff erent  base-emitter  curves

In Fig. 15-16, the output voltage is the superposition of all input effects. To begin 
with, there is the ideal ac input:
vin 5 v1 2 v2
This is what we want. It is the voltage coming from the two input sources. It is 
amplifi  ed to produce the desired ac output:
vout 5 Av(v1 2 v2)
 Then, there are the three unwanted dc error inputs. With Eqs. (15-13 a) 
and (15-13 b), we can derive these formulas:
V1err 5 (RB1 2 RB2)Iin(bias)  (15-16)
V2err 5 (RB1 1 RB2)   Iin(off) _____ 2   (15-17)
V3err 5 Vin(off)  (15-18)
The advantage of these formulas is that they use Iin(bias)  and Iin(off), quantities on the 
data sheet. The three dc errors are amplifi  ed to produce the output error voltage:
Verror 5 Av(V1err 1 V2err 1 V3err) (15-19)
 In many cases, Verror can be ignored. This will depend on the application. 
For instance, if we are building an ac amplifi  er, Verror may not be important. It is 
only when we are building some kind of precision dc amplifi  er that Verror needs to 
be taken into account.
Equal  Base  Resistances
When the bias and offset errors cannot be ignored, here are the remedies. As 
 already mentioned, one of the fi  rst things a designer can do is to use equal base 
 resistances: RB1 5 RB2 5 RB. This brings the two halves of the diff amp into a 
closer alignment because Eqs. (15-16) through (15-19) become:

Conclusion
Summary Table 15-3 summarizes the sources of output error voltage. In many 
applications, the output error voltage is either small enough to ignore or not im-
portant in the particular application. In precision applications in which the dc 
output is important, some form of nulling is used to eliminate the effects of input 
bias and offset. Designers usually null the output with methods suggested on the

Figure 15-19 a shows a differential input and single-ended output. The same 
input voltage vin(CM)  is being applied to each base. This voltage is called a com-
mon-mode  signal.  If the diff amp is perfectly symmetrical, there is no ac output 
voltage with a common-mode input signal because v1 5 v2. When a diff amp is not 
perfectly symmetrical, there will be a small ac output voltage.
 In Fig. 15-19 a, equal voltages are applied to the noninverting and in-
verting inputs. Nobody would deliberately use a diff amp this way because the 
output voltage is ideally zero. The reason for discussing this type of input is be-
cause most static, interference, and other kinds of undesirable pickup are com-
mon-mode signals.
 Here is how a common-mode signal appears: The connecting wires on 
the input bases act like small antennas. If the diff amp is operating in an envi-
ronment with a lot of electromagnetic interference, each base acts like a small 
antenna that picks up an unwanted signal voltage. One of the reasons the diff amp 
is so popular is because it discriminates against these common-mode signals. In 
other words, a diff amp does not amplify common-mode signals.
 Here is an easy way to fi  nd the voltage gain for a common-mode signal: 
We can redraw the circuit, as shown in Fig. 15-19 b. Since equal voltages vin(CM)
drive both inputs simultaneously, there is almost no current through the wire 
 between the emitters. Therefore, we can remove the connecting wire, as shown in 
Fig. 15-20.

The common-mode  rejection  ratio  (CMRR)  is defi  ned as the voltage gain 
 divided by common-mode voltage gain. In symbols:
CMRR  5   Av ______ Av(CM)   (15-21)
For instance, if Av 5 200 and Av(CM) 5 0.5, CMRR 5 400.
 The higher the CMRR, the better. A high CMRR means that the diff amp is 
amplifying the wanted signal and discriminating against the common-mode signal.
 Data sheets usually specify CMRR in decibels, using the following 
 formula for the decibel conversion:
CMRR dB 5 20 log CMRR (15-22)
As an example, if CMRR 5 400:
CMRR dB 5 20 log 400 5 52 dBFigure  15-20   Right  side acts like swamped  ampliﬁ  er  with common-mode  input.

up a common-mode signal of 1 mV, what is the output voltage?
SOLUTION   The input has two components: the desired signal and a com-
mon-mode signal. Both are equal in amplitude. The desired component is ampli-
fi  ed to get an output of:
vout1 5 150(1 mV) 5 150 mV
The common-mode signal is attenuated to get an output of:
vout2 5 0.5(1 mV) 5 0.5 mV
The total output is the sum of these two components:
vout 5 vout1 1 vout2
The output contains both components, but the desired component is 300 times 
greater than the unwanted component.
This example shows why the diff amp is useful as the input stage of an 
op amp. It attenuates the common-mode signal. This is a distinct advantage over 
the ordinary CE amplifi  er, which amplifi  es a stray pickup signal the same way it

The invention of the integrated  circuit  (IC) in 1959 was a major breakthrough 
because the components are no longer discrete; they are integrated.  This means 
that they are produced and connected during the manufacturing process on a sin-
gle chip,  a small piece of semiconductor material. Because the components are 
microscopically small, a manufacturer can place thousands of these integrated 
components in the space occupied by a single discrete transistor.
 What follows is a brief description of how an IC is made. Current manu-
facturing processes are much more complicated, but the simplifi  ed discussion will 
give you the basic idea behind the making of a bipolar IC.
Basic  Idea
First, the manufacturer produces a p crystal several inches long (Fig. 15-23 a). 
This is sliced into many thin wafers,  as in Fig. 15-23 b. One side of the wafer is 
lapped and polished to get rid of surface imperfections. This wafer is called the 
p substrate. It will be used as a chassis for the integrated components. Next, the 
wafers are put into a furnace. A gas mixture of silicon atoms and pentavalent 
atoms passes over the wafers. This forms a thin layer of n-type semiconductor on 
the heated surface of the substrate (see Fig. 15-23 c). We call this thin layer an epi-
taxial  layer.  As shown in Fig. 15-23 c, the epitaxial layer is about 0.1 to 1 mil thick.
 To prevent contamination of the epitaxial layer, pure oxygen is blown 
over the surface. The oxygen atoms combine with the silicon atoms to form a 
layer of silicon dioxide (SiO 2) on the surface, as shown in Fig. 15-23 d. This glass-
like layer of SiO 2 seals off the surface and prevents further chemical reactions. 
Sealing off the surface like this is known as passivation.
 The wafer is then cut into the rectangular areas shown in Fig. 15-24. 
Each of these areas will be a separate chip after the wafer is cut. But before the 
wafer is cut, the manufacturer produces hundreds of circuits on the wafer, one on 
each chip area of Fig. 15-24. This simultaneous mass production is the reason for 
the low cost of ICs.
 Here is how an integrated transistor is formed: Part of the SiO 2 is etched 
off, exposing the epitaxial layer (see Fig. 15-25 a). The wafer is then put into a fur-
nace, and trivalent atoms are diffused into the epitaxial layer. The concentration 
of trivalent atoms is enough to change the exposed epitaxial layer from n mate-
rial to p material. Therefore, we get an island of n material under the SiO 2 layer 
(Fig. 15-25 b). Oxygen is again blown over the surface to form the complete SiO 2
layer shown in Fig. 15-25 c.
 A hole is now etched in the center of the SiO 2 layer. This exposes the n
epitaxial layer (Fig. 15-25 d). The hole in the SiO 2 layer is called a window.  We are 
now looking down at what will be the collector of the transistor.Figure 15-23   (a) Pcrystal; (b) wafer; (c) epitaxial layer; (d) insulating layer.

Figure  15-24   Cutting  wafer  
into chips.652 Chapter 15 To get the base, we pass trivalent atoms through this window; these 
 impurities diffuse into the epitaxial layer and form an island of p-type material 
(Fig. 15-25 e). Then, the SiO 2 layer is re-formed by passing oxygen over the wafer 
(Fig. 15-25 f).
 To form the emitter, we etch a window in the SiO 2 layer and expose the 
p island (Fig. 15-25 g). By diffusing pentavalent atoms into the p island, we can 
form the small n island shown in Fig. 15-25 h.
 We then passivate the structure by blowing oxygen over the wafer 
(Fig. 15-25 i). By etching windows in the SiO 2 layer, we can deposit metal to make 
electrical contact with the emitter, base, and collector. This gives us the integrated 
transistor of Fig. 15-26 a.
 To get a diode, we follow the same steps up to the point at which the 
p island has been formed and sealed off (Fig. 15-25 f). Then, we etch windows 
to expose the p and n islands. By depositing metal through these windows, 
we make electrical contact with the cathode and anode of the integrated diode 
(Fig. 15-26 b). By etching two windows above the p island of Fig. 15-25 f, we 
can make metallic contact with this p island; this gives us an integrated resistor 
(Fig. 15-26 c).Figure  15-25   Steps  in making  a transistor.

(c)pRESISTORDifferential Ampliﬁ  ers 653 Transistors, diodes, and resistors are easy to fabricate on a chip. For this 
reason, almost all ICs use these components. It is not practical to integrate induc-
tors and large capacitors on the surface of a chip.
A Simple  Example
To give you an idea of how a circuit is produced, look at the simple three-
component circuit of Fig. 15-27 a. To fabricate this circuit, we would simulta-
neously produce hundreds of circuits like this on a wafer. Each chip area would 
 resemble Fig. 15-27 b. The diode and resistor would be formed at the point men-
tioned earlier. At a later step, the emitter of the transistor would be formed. Then 
we would etch windows and deposit metal to connect the diode, transistor, and 
 resistor, as shown in Fig. 15-27 b.
 Regardless of how complicated a circuit may be, producing it is mainly 
a process of etching windows, forming p and n islands, and connecting the inte-
grated components. The p substrate isolates the integrated components from each 
other. In Fig. 15-27 b, there are depletion layers between the p substrate and the 
three n islands that touch it. Because the depletion layers have essentially no cur-
rent carriers, the integrated components are insulated from one another. This kind 
of insulation is known as depletion-layer  isolation.
Types  of ICs
The integrated circuits we have described are called monolithic  ICs. The word 
monolithic  is from the Greek and means “one stone.” The word is appropriate be-
cause the components are part of one chip. Monolithic ICs are the most common 
type of IC. Since their invention, manufacturers have been producing monolithic 
ICs to carry out all kinds of functions.
 Commercially available types can be used as amplifi  ers, voltage regula-
tors, crowbars, AM receivers, television circuits, and computer circuits. But the 
monolithic IC has power limitations. Since most monolithic ICs are about the size 
of a discrete small-signal transistor, they are used in low-power applications.
 When higher power is needed, thin-fi  lm and thick-fi  lm ICs may be used. 
These devices are larger than monolithic ICs but smaller than discrete circuits. 
With a thin- or thick-fi  lm IC, the passive components like resistors and capacitors 
are integrated, but the transistors and diodes are connected as discrete components 
to form a complete circuit. Therefore, commercially available thin- and thick-fi  lm 
circuits are combinations of integrated and discrete components.Figure  15-27   Simple  IC.

(b)654 Chapter 15 Another IC used in high-power applications is the hybrid  IC. Hybrid 
ICs combine two or more monolithic ICs in one package, or they combine mon-
olithic ICs with thin- or thick-fi  lm circuits. Hybrid ICs are widely used for high-
power audio-amplifi  er applications from 5 to more than 50 W.
Levels  of Integration
Figure 15-27 b is an example of small-scale  integration  (SSI);  only a few compo-
nents have been integrated to form a complete circuit. SSI refers to ICs with fewer 
than 12 integrated components. Most SSI chips use integrated resistors, diodes, 
and bipolar transistors.
 Medium-scale  integration  (MSI)  refers to ICs that have from 12 to 100 
integrated components per chip. Either bipolar transistors or MOS transistors 
 (enhancement-mode MOSFETS) can be used as the integrated transistors of an 
IC. Again, most MSI chips use bipolar components.
 Large-scale  integration  (LSI)  refers to ICs with more than a hundred 
components. Since it takes fewer steps to make an integrated MOS transistor, a 
manufacturer can produce more components on a chip than is possible with bipo-
lar transistors.
 Very  large-scale integration  (VLSI)  refers to placing thousands (or 
 hundreds of thousands) of components on a single chip. Nearly all modern chips 
employ VLSI.
 Finally, there is ultra  large-scale integration  (ULSI),  which refers to 
placing more than 1 million components on a single chip. Various versions of mi-
croprocessors have been developed containing over 1 billion internal components. 
The exponential growth, often referred to as Moore’s law, is being challenged. 
However, new technologies, such as nanotechno logy, and refi  ned manufacturing 
processes should allow the continued growth to occur.
15-7  The  Current  Mirror
With ICs, there is a way to increase the voltage gain and CMRR of a diff amp. 
Figure 15-28 a shows a compensating  diode  in parallel with the emitter diode of 
a transistor. The current through the resistor is given by:
IR 5   VCC 2VBE _________  R   (15-23)
If the compensating diode and the emitter diode have identical current-voltage 
curves, the collector current will equal the current through the resistor:

1 MΩGOOD  TO KNOW
The current  mirror  concept  is 
used  with  Class -B push-pull  
amplifiers,  in which  the compen-
sating  diodes  on the base  side  
match  the base-emitter  junctions  
of the push-pull  transistors.Differential Ampliﬁ  ers 655 A circuit like Fig. 15-28 a is called a current  mirror  because the col-
lector current is a mirror image of the resistor current. With ICs, it is relatively 
easy to match the characteristics of the compensating diode and the emitter diode 
 because both components are on the same chip. Current mirrors are used as cur-
rent sources and active loads in the design of IC op amps.
Current  Mirror  Sources  the Tail Current
With a single-ended output, the voltage gain of a diff amp is RC/2re9 and the 
 common-mode voltage gain is RC/2RE. The ratio of the two gains gives:
CMRR 5   RE ___ r9e  
The larger we can make RE, the greater the CMRR.
 One way to get a high equivalent RE is to use a current mirror to produce 
the tail current, as shown in Fig. 15-29. The current through the compensating 
diode is:
IR 5   VCC 1 VEE 2 VBE  ________________  R   (15-25)
Because of the current mirror, the tail current has the same value. Since Q4 acts 
like a current source, it has a very high output impedance. As a result, the equiva-
lent RE of the diff amp is in hundreds of megohms and the CMRR is dramatically 
improved. In Fig. 15-29, notice Q3 is shown as a diode. This is because transistor 
Q3 has its base and collector leads shorted together, making it act as a diode. This 
is commonly done inside ICs.
Active  Load
The voltage gain of a single-ended diff amp is RC/2re9. The larger we can make 
RC, the greater the voltage gain. Figure 15-30 shows a current mirror used as an 
active  load resistor.  Since Q6 is a pnp current source, Q2 sees an equivalent RC
that is hundreds of megohms. As a result, the voltage gain is much higher with 
an active load than with an ordinary resistor. Active loading like this is used in 
most op amps.

Q3Q2RC656 Chapter 1515-8  The  Loaded  Diff   Amp
In the earlier discussions of a diff amp, we did not use a load resistor. When a load 
resistor is used, the analysis becomes much more complicated, especially with a 
differential output.
 Figure 15-31 a shows a differential output with a load resistor between 
the collectors. There are several ways to calculate the effect that this load resistor 
has on the output voltage. If you try to solve this with Kirchhoff loop equations, 
you will have a very diffi  cult problem. But with Thevenin’s theorem, the problem 
unravels very quickly.
 Here is how it is done: If we open the load resistor in Fig. 15-31 a, the 
Thevenin voltage is the same as the vout calculated in earlier discussions. Also, 
looking into the open AB terminals with all sources zeroed, we see a Thevenin 
 resistance of 2 RC. (Note:  Because the transistors are current sources, they become 
open when zeroed.)Figure  15-30   Current  mirror  is an active  load.

Summary
SEC.  15-1  THE  DIFFERENTIAL  
AMPLIFIER
A diff  amp  is the typical  input  stage  
of an op amp.  It has no coupling  or 
bypass  capacitors.  Because  of this, 
it has no lower  cutoff   frequency.  The 
input  may be diff erential,  noninvert-
ing, or inverting.  The output  may be 
single-ended  or diff erential.
SEC.  15-2   DC ANALYSIS  OF A 
DIFF  AMP
The diff  amp  uses  two-supply  emitter  
bias to produce  the tail current.  When  
a diff  amp  is perfectly  symmetrical,  
each  emitter  current  is half the tail 
current.  Ideally,  the voltage  across  
the emitter  resistor  equals  the nega-
tive supply  voltage.
SEC.  15-3   AC ANALYSIS  OF A 
DIFF  AMP
Because  the tail current  is ideally  
constant,  an increase  in the emitter  
current  of one transistor  produces  
a decrease  in the emitter  current  of 
the other  transistor.  With  a diff erential  
output,  the voltage  gain  is RC/re9. With  
a single-ended  output,  the voltage  
gain  is half as much.SEC. 15-4  INPUT CHARACTER-
ISTICS OF AN 
OP AMP
Three  important  input  characteristics  
of an op amp  are the input  bias cur-
rent,  input  off set current,  and input  
off set voltage.  The input  bias and 
off set currents  produce  unwanted  
input  error  voltages  when  they  ﬂ o w 
through  the base  resistors.  The input  
off set voltage  is an equivalent  input  
error  produced  by diff erences  in RC 
and VBE.
SEC.  15-5   COMMON-MODE  
GAIN
Most  static,  interference,  and other  
kinds  of electromagnetic  pickup  are 
common-mode  signals.  The diff  amp  
discriminates  against  common-mode  
signals.  The CMRR  is the voltage  gain  
divided  by the common-mode  gain.  
The higher  the CMRR,  the better.
SEC.  15-6   INTEGRATED  
CIRCUITS
Monolithic  ICs are complete  circuit  
functions  on a single  chip such  as 
ampliﬁ  ers,  voltage  regulators,  and computer  circuits.  For high-power  
applications,  thin-ﬁ  lm,  thick-ﬁ  lm,  and 
hybrid  ICs may be used.  SSI refers  
to fewer  than  12 components,  MSI 
to between  12 and 100 components,  
LSI to more  than  100 components,  
VLSI  to more  than  1000  components,  
and ULSI  to more  than  1 million  
components.
SEC.  15-7   THE  CURRENT  
MIRROR
The current  mirror  is used  in ICs be-
cause  it is a convenient  way to create  
current  sources  and active  loads.  The 
advantages  of using  current  mirrors  
are increases  in voltage  gain  and 
CMRR.
SEC.  15-8   THE  LOADED  DIFF  
AMP
When  a load  resistance  is used  with 
a diff  amp,  the best  approach  is to 
use Thevenin’s  theorem.  Calculate  
the ac output  voltage  vout as dis-
cussed  in earlier  sections.  This volt-
age is equal  to the Thevenin  voltage.  
Use a Thevenin  resistance  of 2RC 
with a diff erential  output  and RC with 
a single-ended  output.Differential Ampliﬁ  ers 659– +

Although some high-power op amps are available, most are 
low-power devices with a maximum power rating of less than 
a watt. Some op amps are optimized for bandwidth, others for 
low input off  sets, others for low noise, and so on. This is why the 
variety of commercially available op amps is so large. You can 
ﬁ  nd an op amp for almost any analog application.
Op amps are some of the most basic active components in 
analog systems. For instance, by connecting two external 
resistors, we can adjust the voltage gain and bandwidth of an op 
amp to our exact requirements. Furthermore, with other external 
components, we can build waveform converters, oscillators, 
active ﬁ  lters, and other interesting circuits.

Devices668 Chapter 1616-1 Introduction to Op Amps
Figure 16-1 shows a block diagram of an op amp. The input stage is a diff amp, 
followed by more stages of gain, and a Class-B push-pull emitter follo wer.  Because 
a diff amp is the fi  rst stage, it determines the input characteristics of the op amp. 
In most op amps, the output is single-ended, as shown. With positive and negative 
supplies, the single-ended output is designed to have a quiescent value of zero. 
This way, zero input voltage ideally results in zero output voltage.
Not all op amps are designed like Fig. 16-1. For instance, some do not 
use a Class-B push-pull output, and others may have a double-ended output. Also, 
op amps are not as simple as Fig. 16-1 suggests. The internal design of a mono-
lithic op amp is very complicated, using dozens of transistors as current mirrors, 
active loads, and other innovations that are not possible in discrete designs. For 
our needs, Fig. 16-1 captures two important features that apply to typical op amps: 
the differential input and the single-ended output.
Figure 16-2 a is the schematic symbol of an op amp. It has noninverting 
and inverting inputs and a single-ended output. Ideally, this symbol means that

–Figure 16-2   (a) Schematic symbol for op amp; ( b) equivalent circuit of op amp.Operational Ampliﬁ  ers 669the amplifi  er has infi  nite voltage gain, infi  nite input impedance, and zero output 
impedance. The ideal op amp represents a perfect voltage amplifi  er and is often 
referred to as a voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS).  We can visualize a 
VCVS as shown in Fig. 16-2 b, where Rin is infi  nite and Rout is zero.
Summary Table 16-1 summarizes the characteristics of an ideal op amp. 
The ideal op amp has infi  nite voltage gain, infi  nite unity-gain frequency, infi  nite 
input impedance, and infi  nite CMRR. It also has zero output resistance, zero bias 
current, and zero offsets. This is what manufacturers would build if they could. 
What they actually can build only approaches these ideal values.
For instance, the LM741C of Summary Table 16-1 is a standard op amp, 
a classic that has been available since the 1960s. Its characteristics are the min-
imum of what to expect from a monolithic op amp. The LM741C has a voltage 
gain of 100,000, a unity-gain frequency of 1 MHz, an input impedance of 2 M V, 
and so on. Because the voltage gain is so high, the input offsets can easily saturate 
the op amp. This is why practical circuits need external components between the 
input and output of an op amp to stabilize the voltage gain. For instance, in many 
applications, negative feedback is used to adjust the overall voltage gain to a 
much lower value in exchange for stable linear operation.
When no feedback path (or loop) is used, the voltage gain is maximum 
and is called the open-loop voltage gain,  designated AVOL. In Summary Table 16-1, 
notice that the AVOL of the LM741C is 100,000. Although not infi  nite, this open-
loop voltage gain is very high. For instance, an input as small as 10 /H9262V produces 
an output of 1 V. Because the open-loop voltage gain is very high, we can use 
heavy negative feedback to improve the overall performance of a circuit.
The 741C has a unity-gain frequency of 1 MHz. This means that we can 
get usable voltage gain almost as high as 1 MHz. The 741C has an input resistance 
of 2 M V, an output resistance of 75 V, an input bias current of 80 nA, an input 
offset current of 20 nA, an input offset voltage of 2 mV, and a CMRR of 90 dB.
When higher input resistance is needed, a designer can use a BIFET op 
amp.  This type of op amp incorporates JFETs and bipolar transistors on the same 
chip. The JFETs are used in the input stage to get smaller input bias and offset 
 currents; the bipolar transistors are used in the later stages to get more voltage gain.
The LF157A is an example of a BIFET op amp. As shown in Summary 
Table 16-1, the input bias current is only 30 pA, and the input resistance is 1012 V. GOOD TO KNOW
Most modern general-purpose 
op amps are now produced with 
BIFET technology because this 
provides superior performance 
over bipolar op amps. BIFET op 
amps, being more modern, gen-
erally have more enhanced per-
formance characteristics, which 
include wider bandwidth, higher 
slew rate, larger power output, 
higher input impedances, and 
lower bias currents.Summary Table 16-1  Typical Op-Amp Characteristics

16-2  The 741 Op Amp
In 1965, Fairchild Semiconductor introduced the /H9262A709, the fi  rst widely used 
monolithic op amp. Although successful, this fi  rst-generation op amp had many 
disadvantages. These led to an improved op amp known as the /H9262A741. Because it 
is inexpensive and easy to use, the /H9262A741 has been an enormous success. Other 
741 designs have appeared from various manufacturers. For instance, ON Sem-
iconductor produces the MC1741, Texas Instruments the LM741, and Analog 
Devices the AD741. All these monolithic op amps are equivalent to the /H9262A741 
because they have the same specifi  cations on their data sheets. For convenience, 
most people drop the prefi  xes and refer to this widely used op amp simply as 
the 741.
An Industry Standard
The 741 has become an industry standard. As a rule, you try to use it fi  rst in your 
designs. In cases when you cannot meet a design specifi  cation with a 741, you 
upgrade to a better op amp. Because it is a standard, we will use the 741 as a basic 
device in our discussions. Once you understand the 741, you can branch out to 
other op amps.
Incidentally, the 741 has different versions numbered 741, 741A, 741C, 
741E, and 741N. These differ in their voltage gain, temperature range, noise 
level, and other characteristics. The 741C (the C stands for “commercial grade”) 
is the least expensive and most widely used. It has an open-loop voltage gain 
of 100,000, an input impedance of 2 M V, and an output impedance of  75 V.

Figure 16-4 is a simplifi  ed schematic diagram of the 741. This circuit is equivalent 
to the 741 and many later-generation op amps. You do not need to understand 
every detail about the circuit design, but you should have a general idea of how the 
circuit works. With that in mind, here is the basic idea behind a 741.
The input stage is a diff amp ( Q1 and Q2). In the 741, Q14 is a current 
source that replaces the tail resistor. R2, Q13, and Q14 are a current mirror that pro-
duces the tail current for Q1 and Q2. Instead of using an ordinary resistor as the col-
lector resistor of the diff amp, the 741 uses an active-load resistor. This active-load 
Q4 acts like a current source with an extremely high impedance. Because of this, the 
voltage gain of the diff amp is much higher than with a passive-load  resistor.
The amplifi  ed signal from the diff amp drives the base of Q5, an emitter 
follower. This stage steps up the impedance level to avoid loading down the diff 
amp. The signal out of Q5 goes to Q6. Diodes Q7 and Q8 are part of the biasing 
for the fi  nal stage. Q11 is an active-load resistor for Q6. Therefore, Q6 and Q11 are 
like a CE driver stage with a very high voltage gain. As explained in the previous 
chapter, diode symbols are sometimes used for simplicity when a transistor has 
its base shorted to the collector. For example, Q3 is actually a transistor with its 
base-collector shorted and acts like a diode.
The Final Stage
The amplifi  ed signal out of the CE driver stage ( Q6) goes to the fi  nal stage, which is 
a Class-B push-pull emitter follower ( Q9 and Q10). Because of the split supply (equal 
positive VCC and negative VEE voltages), the quiescent output is ideally 0 V when the 
input voltage is zero. Any deviation from 0 V is called the output error voltage.R2Q 13

put voltage vout. When v2 is greater than v1, the input voltage vin produces a neg-
ative output voltage vout. Ideally, vout can be as positive as 1VCC and as negative 
as 2VEE before clipping occurs. The output swing is normally within 1 to 2 V of 
each supply voltage because of voltage drops inside the 741.
Active Loading
In Fig. 16-4, we have two examples of active loading  (using transistors instead of 
resistors for loads). First, there is the active-load Q4 on the input diff amp. Sec-
ond, there is the active-load Q11 in the CE driver stage. Because current sources 
have high output impedances, active loads produce much higher voltage gain than 
is possible with resistors. These active loads produce a typical voltage gain of 
100,000 for the 741C. Active loading is very popular in integrated circuits (ICs) 
because it is easier and less expensive to fabricate transistors on a chip than it is 
to fabricate resistors.
Frequency Compensation
In Fig. 16-4, Cc is a compensating capacitor.  Because of the Miller effect, this 
small capacitor (typically 30 pF) is multiplied by the voltage gain of Q5 and Q6 to 
get a much larger equivalent capacitance of:
Cin(M) 5 (Av 1 1)Cc
where Av is the voltage gain of the Q5 and Q6 stages.
The resistance facing this Miller capacitance is the output impedance of 
the diff amp. Therefore, we have a lag circuit. This lag circuit produces a cutoff 
frequency of 10 Hz in a 741C. The open-loop gain of the op amp is down 3 dB at 
this cutoff frequency. Then, AVOL decreases approximately 20 dB per decade until 
reaching the unity-gain frequency.
Figure 16-5 shows the ideal Bode plot of open-loop voltage gain versus 
frequency. The 741C has an open-loop voltage gain of 100,000, equivalent to 100 
dB. Since the open-loop cutoff frequency is 10 Hz, the voltage gain breaks at 10 
Hz and then rolls off at a rate of 20 dB per decade until it is 0 dB at 1 MHz.
A later chapter discusses active fi  lters,  circuits that use op amps, resis-
tors, and capacitors to tailor the frequency response for different applications. At 
that time, we will discuss circuits that produce a fi  rst-order response (20 dB per 
decade rolloff), a second-order response (40 dB per decade rolloff), a third-order 
response (60 dB per decade rolloff), and so on. An op amp that is internally com-
pensated, such as the 741C, has a fi  rst-order response.

Although the 741 is usually con-
nected to both a positive and a 
negative supply voltage, the op 
amp can still be operated using 
a single supply voltage. For ex-
ample, the 2VEE input could be 
grounded and the 1VCC input 
could be connected to a positive 
dc supply voltage.Operational Ampliﬁ  ers 673Incidentally, not all op amps are internally compensated. Some require 
the user to connect an external compensating capacitor to prevent oscillations. 
The advantage of using external compensation is that a designer has more con-
trol over the high-frequency performance. Although an external capacitor is the 
simplest way to compensate, more complicated circuits can be used that not only 
provide compensation but also produce a higher funity than is possible with internal 
compensation.
Bias and Off  sets
As discussed in a previous chapter, a diff amp has input bias and offsets that pro-
duce an output error when there is no input signal. In many applications, the out-
put error is small enough to ignore. But when the output error cannot be ignored, 
a designer can reduce it by using equal base resistors. This eliminates the problem 
of bias current, but not the offset current or offset voltage.
This is why it is best to eliminate output error by using the nulling cir-
cuit given on the data sheet. This recommended nulling circuit works with the 
internal circuitry to eliminate the output error and also to minimize thermal drift,
a slow change in output voltage caused by the effect of changing temperature on 
op-amp parameters. Sometimes, the data sheet of an op amp does not include a 
nulling circuit. In this case, we have to apply a small input voltage to null the 
output. We will discuss this method later.
Figure 16-6 shows the nulling method suggested on the data sheet of a 
741C. The ac source driving the inverting input has a Thevenin resistance of RB. 
To neutralize the effect of input bias current (80 nA) fl  owing through this source 
resistance, a discrete resistor of equal value is added to the noninverting input, as 
shown.
To eliminate the effect of an input offset current of 20 nA and an input 
offset voltage of 2 mV, the data sheet of a 741C recommends using a 10-k V
 potentiometer between pins 1 and 5. By adjusting this potentiometer with no input 
signal, we can null or zero the output voltage.
Common-Mode Rejection Ratio
For a 741C, CMRR is 90 dB at low frequencies. Given equal signals, one a 
 desired signal and the other a common-mode signal, the desired signal will be 
90 dB larger at the output than the common-mode signal. In ordinary numbers, 
this means that the desired signal will be approximately 30,000 times larger 
than the common-mode signal. At higher frequencies, reactive effects degrade

kHz, 56 dB at 10 kHz, and so on.
Maximum Peak-to-Peak Output
The MPP value of an amplifi  er is the maximum peak-to-peak output that the am-
plifi er can produce without clipping. Since the quiescent output of an op amp is 
ideally zero, the ac output voltage can swing positively or negatively. For load 
resistances that are much larger than Rout, the output voltage can swing almost to 
the supply voltages. For instance, if VCC 5 115 V and VEE 5 215 V , the MPP 
value with a load resistance of 10 k V is ideally 30 V .
With a nonideal op amp, the output cannot swing all the way to the value 
of the supply voltages because there are small voltage drops in the fi  nal stage of 
the op amp. Furthermore, when the load resistance is not large compared to Rout, 
some of the amplifi  ed voltage is dropped across Rout, which means that the fi  nal 
output voltage is smaller.
Figure 16-7 b shows MPP versus load resistance for a 741C with supply 
voltages of 115 V and 215 V. Notice that MPP is approximately 27 V for an RL of 100

at 213.5 V. When the load resistance decreases, MPP decreases as shown. For 
instance, if the load resistance is only 275 V, MPP decreases to 16 V, which means 
that the output saturates positively at 18 V and negatively at 28 V.
Short-Circuit Current
In some applications, an op amp may drive a load resistance of approximately 
zero. In this case, you need to know the value of the short-circuit output cur-
rent.  The data sheet of a 741C lists a short-circuit output current of 25 mA. This is 
the maximum output current the op amp can produce. If you are using small load 
resistors (less than 75 V), don’t expect to get a large output voltage because the 
voltage cannot be greater than the 25 mA times the load resistance.
Frequency Response
Figure 16-7 c shows the small-signal frequency response of a 741C. In the mid-
band, the voltage gain is 100,000. The 741C has a cutoff frequency fc of 10 Hz. 
As indicated, the voltage gain is 70,700 (down 3 dB) at 10 Hz. Above the cutoff 
 frequency, the voltage gain decreases at a rate of 20 dB per decade (fi  rst-order 
 response).
The unity-gain frequency is the frequency at which the voltage gain 
equals 1. In Fig. 16-7 c, funity is 1 MHz. Data sheets usually specify the value of 
funity because it represents the upper limit on the useful gain of an op amp. For 
instance, the data sheet of a 741C lists an funity of 1 MHz. This means that the 
741C can amplify signals up to 1 MHz. Beyond 1 MHz, the voltage gain is less 
than 1 and the 741C is useless. If a designer needs a higher funity, better op amps 
are available. For instance, the LM318 has an funity of 15 MHz, which means that 
it can produce usable voltage gain all the way to 15 MHz.
Slew Rate
The compensating capacitor inside a 741C performs a very important function: 
It prevents oscillations that would interfere with the desired signal. But there is 
a disadvantage. The compensating capacitor needs to be charged and discharged. 
This creates a speed limit on how fast the output of the op amp can change.
Here is the basic idea: Suppose the input voltage to an op amp is a pos-
itive voltage step,  a sudden transition in voltage from one dc level to a higher 
dc level. If the op amp were perfect, we would get the ideal response shown in 
Fig. 16-8 a. Instead, the output is the positive exponential waveform shown. This 
occurs because the compensating capacitor must be charged before the output 
voltage can change to the higher level.
In Fig. 16-8 a, the initial slope of the exponential waveform is called the 
slew rate,  symbolized SR. The defi  nition of slew rate is:
SR 5   Dvout _____ Dt   (16-1)
where the Greek letter D (delta) stands for “the change in.” In words, the equation 
says that slew rate equals the change in output voltage divided by the change in 
time.
Figure 16-8 b illustrates the meaning of slew rate. The initial slope equals 
the vertical change divided by the horizontal change between two points on the 
early part of the exponential wave. For instance, if the exponential wave increases 
0.5 V during the fi  rst microsecond, as shown in Fig. 16-8 c, the slew rate is:
SR 5   0.5 V _____ 1 /H9262s   5 0.5 V/ /H9262s676 Chapter 16(a)

exceeds slew rate.The slew rate represents the fastest response that an op amp can have. 
For instance, the slew rate of a 741C is 0.5 V/ /H9262s. This means that the output of a 
741C can change no faster than 0.5 V in a microsecond. In other words, if a 741C 
is driven by a large step in input voltage, we do not get a sudden step in output 
voltage. Instead, we get an exponential output wave. The initial part of this output 
waveform will look like Fig. 16-8 c.
We can also get slew-rate limiting with a sinusoidal signal. Here is how 
it occurs: In Fig. 16-9 a, the op amp can produce the output sine wave shown only 
if the initial slope of the sine wave is less than the slew rate. For instance, if the 
output sine wave has an initial slope of 0.1 V/ /H9262s, a 741C can produce this sine 
wave with no trouble at all because its slew rate is 0.5 V/ /H9262s. On the other hand, if 
the sine wave has an initial slope of 1 V/ /H9262s, the output is smaller than it should be 
and it looks triangular instead of sinusoidal, as shown in Fig. 16-9 b.
The data sheet of an op amp always specifi  es the slew rate because this 
quantity limits the large-signal response of an op amp. If the output sine wave is 
very small or the frequency is very low, slew rate is no problem. But when the 
signal is large and the frequency is high, slew rate will distort the output signal.
With calculus, it is possible to derive this equation:
SS5 2/H9266fVpOperational Ampliﬁ  ers 677where SS is the initial slope of the sine wave, f is its frequency, and Vp is its peak 
value. To avoid slew-rate distortion of a sine wave, SS has to be less than or equal 
to SR. When the two are equal, we are at the limit, on the verge of slew-rate dis-
tortion. In this case:
SR 5 SS 5 2/H9266fVp
Solving for f gives:
fmax 5   SR _____ 2pVp   (16-2)
where fmax is the highest frequency that can be amplifi  ed without slew-rate dis-
tortion. Given the slew rate of an op amp and the peak output voltage desired, we 
can use Eq. (16-2) to calculate the maximum undistorted frequency. Above this 
frequency, we will see slew-rate distortion on an oscilloscope.
The frequency fmax is sometimes called the power bandwidth  or 
large-signal bandwidth  of the op amp. Figure 16-10 is a graph of Eq. (16-2) for 
three slew rates. Since the bottom graph is for a slew rate of 0.5 V/ /H9262s, it is useful 
with a 741C. Since the top graph is for a slew rate of 50 V/ /H9262s, it is useful with an 
LM318 (it has a minimum slew rate of 50 V/ /H9262s).
For instance, suppose we are using a 741C. To get an undistorted output 
peak voltage of 8 V, the frequency can be no higher than 10 kHz (see Fig. 16-10). 
One way to increase the fmax is to accept less output voltage. By trading off peak 
value for frequency, we can improve the power bandwidth. As an example, if our 
application can accept a peak output voltage of 1 V, fmax increases to 80 kHz.
There are two bandwidths to consider when analyzing the operation 
of an op-amp circuit: the small-signal bandwidth determined by the fi  rst-order 
 response of the op amp and the large-signal or power bandwidth determined by 
the slew rate. More will be said about these two bandwidths later.

into negative saturation?
SOLUTION   Figure 16-7 b shows that MPP equals 27 V for a load resistance 
of 10 k V, which translates into an output of 213.5 V for negative saturation. Since 
the 741C has an open-loop voltage gain of 100,000, the required input  voltage is:
v2 5   13.5 V _______ 100,000   5 135 /H9262V
Figure 16-11 b summarizes the answer. As you can see, an inverting input of

PRACTICE PROBLEM 16-6   Repeat Example 16-6 with Vp 5 1 V.680 Chapter 1616-3  The Inverting Ampliﬁ  er
The inverting amplifi  er is the most basic op-amp circuit. It uses negative feed-
back to stabilize the overall voltage gain. The reason we need to stabilize the over-
all voltage gain is because AVOL is too high and unstable to be of any use without 
some form of feedback. For instance, the 741C has a minimum AVOL of 20,000 
and a maximum AVOL of more than 200,000. An unpredictable voltage gain of this 
magnitude and variation is useless without feedback.
Inverting Negative Feedback
Figure 16-12 shows an inverting amplifi  er. To keep the drawing simple, the 
power-supply voltages are not shown. In other words, we are looking at the 
ac-equivalent circuit. An input voltage vin drives the inverting input through 
resistor R1. This results in an inverting input voltage of v2. The input voltage is 
amplifi  ed by the open-loop voltage gain to produce an inverted output  voltage. 
The output voltage is fed back to the input through feedback resistor Rf. This 
 results in negative feedback because the output is 180° out of phase with the 
input. In other words, any changes in v2 produced by the input voltage are 
 opposed by the output signal.
Here is how the negative feedback stabilizes the overall voltage gain: If 
the open-loop voltage gain AVOL increases for any reason, the output voltage will 
increase and feed back more voltage to the inverting input. This opposing feedback 
voltage reduces v2. Therefore, even though AVOL has increased, v2 has decreased, 
and the fi  nal output increases much less than it would without the negative feed-
back. The overall result is a very slight increase in output voltage, so small that it 
is hardly noticeable. In the next chapter, we will discuss the mathematical details 
of negative feedback and you will better understand how small the changes are.
Virtual Ground
When we connect a piece of wire between some point in a circuit and ground, the 
voltage of the point becomes zero. Furthermore, the wire provides a path for cur-
rent to fl  ow to ground. A mechanical ground  (a wire between a point and ground) 
is ground to both voltage and current.
A virtual ground  is different. This type of ground is a widely used 
shortcut for analyzing an inverting amplifi  er. With a virtual ground, the analysis 
of an inverting amplifi  er and related circuits becomes incredibly easy.
The concept of a virtual ground is based on an ideal op amp. When an 
op amp is ideal, it has infi  nite open-loop voltage gain and infi  nite input resistance. 
Because of this, we can deduce the following ideal properties for the inverting 
amplifi  er of Fig. 16-13:
1. Since Rin is infi  nite, i2 is zero.
2. Since AVOL is infi  nite, v2 is zero.

R1iiniinFigure 16-14   Inverting ampliﬁ  er has same current through both resistors.Since i2 is zero in Fig. 16-13, the current through Rf must equal the input current 
through R1, as shown. Furthermore, since v2 is zero, the virtual ground shown in 
Fig. 16-13 means that the inverting input acts like a ground for voltage but an open 
for current!
Virtual ground is very unusual. It is like half of a ground because it is a 
short for voltage but an open for current. To remind us of this half-ground quality, 
Fig. 16-13 uses a dashed line between the inverting input and ground. The dashed 
line means that no current can fl  ow to ground. Although virtual ground is an ideal 
approximation, it gives very accurate answers when used with heavy negative 
feedback.
Voltage Gain
In Fig. 16-14, visualize a virtual ground on the inverting input. Then, the right end 
of R1 is a voltage ground, so we can write:
vin 5 iinR1
Similarly, the left end of Rf is a voltage ground, so the magnitude of output 
voltage is:
vout 5 2iinRf
Divide vout by vin to get the voltage gain where Av 5 vout/vin 5 2iinRf /iinR1. 
Therefore:
Av(CL) 5   2Rf ____ R1   (16-3)
where Av(CL) is the closed-loop voltage gain. This is called the closed-loop voltage 
gain because it is the voltage when there is a feedback path between the output 
and the input. Because of the negative feedback, the closed-loop voltage gain 
Av(CL) is always smaller than the open-loop voltage gain AVOL.682 Chapter 16Look at how simple and elegant Eq. (16-3) is. The closed-loop voltage 
gain equals the ratio of the feedback resistance to the input resistance. For in-
stance, if R1 5 1 kV and Rf 5 50 k V, the closed-loop voltage gain is 50. Because 
of the heavy negative feedback, this closed-loop voltage gain is very stable. If 
AVOL varies because of temperature change, supply voltage variations, or op-amp 
replacement, Av(CL) will still be very close to 50. The negative sign in the voltage 
gain equation indicates a 180 8 phase shift.
Input Impedance
In some applications, a designer may want a specifi  c input impedance. This is 
one of the advantages of an inverting amplifi  er; it is easy to set up a desired input 
 impedance. Here is why: Since the right end of R1 is virtually grounded, the 
closed-loop input impedance is:
zin(CL) 5 R1 (16-4)
This is the impedance looking into the left end of R1, as shown in Fig. 16-14. For 
instance, if an input impedance of 2 k V and a closed-loop voltage gain of 50 is 
needed, a designer can use R1 5 2 kV and Rf 5 100 k V.
Bandwidth
The open-loop bandwidth  or cutoff frequency of an op amp is very low because 
of the internal compensating capacitor. For a 741C:
f2(OL) 5 10 Hz
At this frequency, the open-loop voltage gain breaks and rolls off in a fi  rst-order 
response.
When negative feedback is used, the overall bandwidth increases. Here 
is the reason: When the input frequency is greater than f2(OL), AVOL decreases 
20 dB per decade. When vout tries to decrease, less opposing voltage is fed back 
to the inverting input. Therefore, v2 increases and compensates for the decrease in 
AVOL. Because of this, Av(CL) breaks at a higher frequency than f2(OL). The greater 
the negative feedback, the higher the closed-loop cutoff frequency. Stated another 
way: The smaller Av(CL) is, the higher f2(CL) is.
Figure 16-15 illustrates how the closed-loop bandwidth increases with 
negative feedback. As you can see, the heavier the negative feedback (smaller 
Av(CL)), the greater the closed-loop bandwidth. Here is the equation for an invert-
ing amplifi  er closed-loop bandwidth:
f2(CL) 5   funity —  Av(CL) 1 1  
In most applications, Av(CL) is greater than 10 and the equation simplifi  es to:
f2(CL) 5   funity _____ Av(CL)   (16-5)
For instance, when Av(CL) is 10:
f2(CL) 5   1 MHz ______  10   5 100 kHz
which agrees with Fig. 16-14. If Av(CL) is 100:
f2(CL) 5   1 MHz ______ 100   5 10 kHz
which also agrees.GOOD TO KNOW
An inverting amplifier can have 
more than one input because, 
with the virtual ground point, 
each input is effectively isolated 
from the other. Each input sees 
its own input resistance and 
nothing else.Operational Ampliﬁ  ers 683Equation (16-5) can be rearranged into:
funity 5 Av(CL)f2(CL) (16-6)
Notice that the unity-gain frequency equals the product of gain and bandwidth. For 
this reason, many data sheets refer to the unity-gain frequency as the gain-band-
width product (GBW).
(Note:  No consistent symbol is used on data sheets for the open-loop 
voltage gain. You may see any of the following: AOL, Av, Avo, or Avol. It is usually 
clear from the data sheet that all these symbols represent the open-loop voltage 
gain of the op amp. We will use AVOL in this textbook.
Bias and Off  sets
Negative feedback reduces the output error caused by input bias current, input off-
set current, and input offset voltage. As discussed in a previous chapter, the three 
input error voltages and the equation for total output error voltage is:
Verror 5 AVOL(V1err 1 V2err 1 V3err)
When negative feedback is used, this equation may be written as:
Verror > 6Av(CL)(6V1err 6 V2err 6 V3err) (16-7)
where Verror is the total output error voltage. Notice that Eq. (16-7) includes 
6 signs. Data sheets do not include 6 signs because it is implied that errors can 
be in either direction. For instance, either base current can be larger than the other, 
and the input offset voltage can be plus or minus.
In mass production, the input errors may add up in the worst possible 
way. The input errors were discussed in an earlier chapter and are repeated here:

enough to ignore. If not, resistor compensation and offset nulling will be necessary.
In an inverting amplifi  er, RB2 is the Thevenin resistance seen when look-
ing back from the inverting input toward the source. This resistance is given by:
RB2 5 R1 i Rf (16-11)
If it is necessary to compensate for input bias current, an equal resistance RB1
should be connected to the noninverting input. This resistance has no effect on 
the virtual-ground approximation because no ac signal current fl  ows through it.
Example  16-7
Figure 16-16 a is an ac-equivalent circuit, so we can ignore the output error caused by input bias and offsets. What are the 
closed-loop voltage gain and bandwidth? What is the output voltage at 1 kHz? At 1 MHz?
SOLUTION   With Eq. (16-3), the closed-loop voltage gain is:
Av(CL) 5   275 kV _______ 1.5 k V   5 250
With Eq. (16-5), the closed-loop bandwidth is:
f2(CL) 5   1 MHz ______  50   5 20 kHz
Figure 16-16 b shows the ideal Bode plot of the closed-loop voltage gain. The decibel equivalent of 50 is 34 dB. (Shortcut: 
50 is half of 100, or down 6 dB from 40 dB.)
 The output voltage at 1 kHz is:
vout 5 (250)(10 mVp-p) 5 2500 mVp-p
Since 1 MHz is the unity-gain frequency, the output voltage at 1 MHz is:
vout 5 210 mVp-p
Again, the minus ( 2) output value indicates a 180° phase shift between the input and output.

The noninverting amplifi  er is another basic op-amp circuit. It uses negative feed-
back to stabilize the overall voltage gain. With this type of amplifi  er, the  negative 
feedback also increases the input impedance and decreases the output impedance.
Basic Circuit
Figure 16-18 shows the ac-equivalent circuit of a noninverting amplifi  er. An input 
voltage vin drives the noninverting input. This input voltage is amplifi  ed to pro-
duce the in-phase output voltage shown. Part of output voltage is fed back to the 
input through a voltage divider. The voltage across R1 is the feedback voltage 
 applied to the inverting input. This feedback voltage is almost equal to the input 
voltage. Because of the high open-loop voltage gain, the difference between v1
and v2 is very small. Since the feedback voltage opposes the input voltage, we 
have negative feedback.
Here is how the negative feedback stabilizes the overall voltage gain: If 
the open-loop voltage gain AVOL increases for any reason, the output voltage will 
increase and feed back more voltage to the inverting input. This opposing feed-
back voltage reduces the net input voltage v1 2 v2. Therefore, even though AVOL
increases, v1 2 v2 decreases, and the fi  nal output increases much less than it would 
Adding the errors in the worst possible way gives an output error voltage of:
Verror 5 650(0.735 mV 1 0.147 mV 1 6 mV) 5 6344 mV
 In Application Example 16-7, the desired output voltage was 500 mVp-p. Can we ignore the large output error volt-
age? It depends on the application. For instance, suppose we only need to amplify audio signals with frequencies between 
20 Hz and 20 kHz. Then, we can capacitively couple the output into the load resistor or next stage. This will block the dc 
output error voltage but transmit the ac signal. In this case, the output error is irrelevant.
 On the other hand, if we want to amplify signals with frequencies from 0 to 20 kHz, then we need to use a better op 
amp (lower bias and offsets), or modify the circuit as shown in Fig. 16-17 b. Here, we have added a compensating resistor 
to the noninverting input to eliminate the effect of input bias current. Also, we are using a 10-k V potentiometer to null the 
effects of input offset current and input offset voltage.

SHORTFigure 16-19   A virtual short exists between the two op-amp inputs.
without the negative feedback. The overall result is only a very slight  increase in 
output voltage.
Virtual Short
When we connect a piece of wire between two points in a circuit, the voltage 
of both points with respect to ground is equal. Furthermore, the wire provides 
a path for current to fl  ow between the two points. A mechanical short  (a wire 
 between two points) is a short for both voltage and current.
A virtual short  is different. This type of short can be used for analyzing 
noninverting amplifi  ers. With a virtual short, we can quickly and easily analyze 
noninverting amplifi  ers and related circuits.
The virtual short uses these two properties of an ideal op amp:
1. Since Rin is infi  nite, both input currents are zero.
2. Since AVOL is infi  nite, v1 2 v2 is zero.
Figure 16-19 shows a virtual short between the input terminals of the op amp. 
The virtual short is a short for voltage but an open for current. As a reminder, the 
dashed line means that no current can fl  ow through it. Although the virtual short 
is an ideal approximation, it gives very accurate answers when used with heavy 
negative feedback.
Here is how we will use the virtual short: Whenever we analyze a non-
inverting amplifi  er or a similar circuit, we can visualize a virtual short between 
the input terminals of the op amp. As long as the op amp is operating in the 
linear  region (not positively or negatively saturated), the open-loop voltage gain 
 approaches infi  nity and a virtual short exists between the two input terminals.
One more point: Because of the virtual short, the inverting input voltage 
follows the noninverting input voltage. If the noninverting input voltage increases 
or decreases, the inverting input voltage immediately increases or decreases to the 
same value. This follow-the-leader action is called bootstrapping  (as in “pulling 
yourself up by your bootstraps”). The noninverting input pulls the inverting input 
up or down to an equal value. Described another way, the inverting input is boot-
strapped to the noninverting input.
Voltage Gain
In Fig. 16-20, visualize a virtual short between the input terminals of the op amp. 
Then, the virtual short means that the input voltage appears across R1, as shown. 
So, we can write:
vin 5 i1R1GOOD TO KNOW
In reference to Fig. 16-19, the 
closed-loop input impedance 
zin(CL) 5 Rin(1 1 AVOLB), where Rin 
represents the open-loop input 
resistance.688 Chapter 16Since no current can fl  ow through a virtual short, the same i1 current must fl  ow 
through Rf, which means that the output voltage is given by:
vout 5 i1(Rf 1 R1)
Divide vout by vin to get the voltage gain:
Av(CL) 5   Rf 1 R1 _______  R1  
or
Av(CL) 5   Rf ___ R1   1 1 (16-12)
This is easy to remember because it is the same as the equation for an inverting am-
plifi er, except that we add 1 to the ratio of resistances. Also, note that the output is in 
phase with the input. Therefore, no ( 2) sign is used in the voltage gain equation. 
Other Quantities
The closed-loop input impedance approaches infi  nity. In the next chapter, we will 
mathematically analyze the effect of negative feedback and will show that neg-
ative feedback increases the input impedance. Since the open-loop input imped-
ance is already very high (2 M V for a 741C), the closed-loop input impedance 
will be even higher.
The effect of negative feedback on bandwidth is the same as with an 
 inverting a mplifi  er:
f2(CL) 5   funity _____ Av(CL)  
Again, we can trade off voltage gain for bandwidth. The smaller the closed-loop 
voltage gain, the greater the bandwidth.
The input error voltages caused by input bias current, input offset cur-
rent, and input offset voltage are analyzed the same way as with an inverting 
 amplifi  er. After calculating each input error, we can multiply by the closed-loop 
voltage gain to get the total output error.
RB2 is the Thevenin resistance seen when looking from the inverting input 
toward the voltage divider. This resistance is the same as for an inverting amplifi  er:
RB2 5 R1 i Rf
If it is necessary to compensate for input bias current, an equal resistance RB1 
should be connected to the noninverting input. This resistance has no effect on the 
virtual-short approximation because no ac signal current fl  ows through it.vout vin

As previously discussed, if we are amplifying ac signals, we can capacitively 
 couple the output signal to the load. In this case, we can ignore the output error 
voltage unless it is excessively large. If the output error voltage is large, it will 
 signifi  cantly reduce the MPP, the maximum unclipped peak-to-peak output.
For instance, if there is no output error voltage, the noninverting am-
plifi er of Fig. 16-21 a can swing to within approximately a volt or two of either 
supply voltage. For simplicity, assume that the output signal can swing from 114 
to 214 V, giving an MPP of 28 V, as shown in Fig. 16-21 b. Now, suppose the 
output error voltage is 110 V, as shown in Fig. 16-21 c. With this large output 
error voltage, the maximum unclipped peak-to-peak swing is from 114 to 16 V, 
an MPP of only 8 V. This may still be all right if the application does not require 
a large output signal. Here is the point to remember: The greater the output error 
voltage, the smaller the MPP value.vout vin+

Example  16-10
In Fig. 16-22 a, what are the closed-loop voltage gain and bandwidth? What is the 
output voltage at 250 kHz?
SOLUTION   With Eq. (16-12):
Av(CL) 5   3.9 k V _______ 100 k V   1 1 5 40
Dividing the unity-gain frequency by the closed-loop voltage gain gives:
f2(CL) 5   1 MHz ______  40   5 25 kHz
 Figure 16-22 b shows the ideal Bode plot of closed-loop voltage gain. The 
decibel equivalent of 40 is 32 dB. (Shortcut: 40 5 10 3 2 3 2 or 20 dB 1 6 dB 
1 6 dB 5 32 dB.) Since the Av(CL) breaks at 25 kHz, it is down 20 dB at 250 kHz. 690 Chapter 16
This means that Av(CL) 5 12 dB at 250 kHz, which is equivalent to an ordinary 
voltage gain of 4. Therefore, the output voltage at 250 kHz is:
vout 5 4 (50 mVp-p) 5 200 mVp-p
PRACTICE PROBLEM 16-10   In Fig. 16-22, change the 3.9-k V resistor to 
4.9 k V. Solve for Av(CL) and vout at 200 kHz.
Example  16-11
For convenience, we repeat the worst-case parameters of a 741C: Iin(bias)  5 500 nA, 
Iin(off) 5 200 nA, and Vin(off) 5 6 mV. What is the output error voltage in Fig. 16-22 a?
SOLUTION   RB2 is the parallel equivalent of 3.9 k V and 100 V, which is approx-
imately 100 V. With Eqs. (16-8) through (16-10), the three input error voltages are:
V1err 5 (RB1 2 RB2)Iin(bias)  5 (2100 V)(500 nA) 5 20.05 mV

Adding the errors in the worst possible way gives an output error voltage of:
Verror 5 640(0.05 mV 1 0.01 mV 1 6 mV) 5 6242 mV
If this output error voltage is a problem, we can use a 10-k V potentiometer, as

Op-amp applications are so broad and varied that it is impossible to discuss them 
comprehensively in this chapter. Besides, we need to understand negative feed-
back better before looking at some of the more advanced applications. For now, 
let us take a look at two practical circuits.
The Summing Ampliﬁ  er
Whenever we need to combine two or more analog signals into a single output, the 
summing amplifi  er of Fig. 16-23 a is a natural choice. For simplicity, the  circuit 
shows only two inputs, but we can have as many inputs as needed for the appli-
cation. A circuit like this amplifi  es each input signal. The gain for each channel
or input is given by the ratio of the feedback resistance to the appropriate input 
resistance. For instance, the closed-loop voltage gains of Fig. 16-23 a are:
Av1(CL) 5   2Rf ____ R1      and    Av2(CL) 5   2Rf ____ R2  
The summing circuit combines all the amplifi  ed input signals into a single output, 
given by:
vout 5 Av1(CL)v1 1 Av2(CL)v2 (16-13)
It is easy to prove Eq. (16-13). Since the inverting input is a virtual 
ground, the total input current is:

producing an output voltage with a magnitude of:
vout 5 (i1 1 i2)Rf 5 2  (   Rf ___ R1   v1 1   Rf ___ R2   v2 ) 
Here you see that each input voltage is multiplied by its channel gain and added to 
produce the total output. The same result applies to any number of inputs.
In some applications, all resistances are equal, as shown in Fig. 16-23 b. 
In this case, each channel has a closed-loop voltage gain of unity (1) and the out-
put is given by:
vout 5 2(v1 1 v2 1 . . . 1 vn)
This is a convenient way of combining input signals and maintaining their relative 
sizes. The combined output signal can then be processed by more circuits.
Figure 16-23 c is a mixer,  a convenient way to combine audio signals in 
a high-fi  delity audio system. The adjustable resistors allow us to set the level of 
each input, and the gain control allows us to adjust the combined output volume. 
By decreasing LEVEL  1, we can make the v1 signal louder at the output. By 
 decreasing LEVEL 2, we can make the v2 signal louder. By increasing GAIN, we 
can make both signals louder.
A fi  nal point: If a summing circuit needs to be compensated by adding 
an equal resistance to the noninverting input, the resistance to use is the Thevenin 
 resistance looking from the inverting input back to the sources. This resistance is 
given by the parallel equivalent of all resistances connected to the virtual ground:
RB2 5 R1 i R2 i Rf i . . . i Rn (16-14)
Voltage Follower
In our study of BJT amplifi  ers, we discussed the emitter follower and saw how 
useful it was for  increasing the input impedance while producing an output signal 
that was almost equal to the input. The voltage follower  is the equivalent of an 
emitter follower, except that it works much better.
Figure 16-24a shows the ac-equivalent circuit for a voltage follower. Al-
though it appears deceptively simple, the circuit is very close to ideal because the 
negative feedback is maximum. As you can see, the feedback resistance is zero. 
Therefore, all the output voltage is fed back to the inverting input. Because of the 
virtual short between the op-amp inputs, the output voltage equals the input voltage:
vout 5 vin
which means that the closed-loop voltage gain is:
Av(CL) 5 1 (16-15)
We can get the same result by calculating the closed-loop voltage gain 
with Eq. (16-12). Since Rf 5 0 and R1 5 `:
Av(CL) 5   Rf ___ R1   1 1 5 1
Therefore, the voltage follower is a perfect follower circuit because it produces an 
output voltage that is exactly equal to the input voltage (or close enough to satisfy 
almost any application).
Furthermore, the maximum negative feedback produces a closed-loop 
input impedance that is much higher than the open-loop input impedance (2 M V 
for a 741C). Also, a maximum negative feedback produces a closed-loop output 
impedance that is much lower than the open-loop output impedance (75 V for 
a 741C). Therefore, we have an almost perfect method for converting a high-
impedance source to a low-impedance source.
Figure 16-24 b illustrates the idea. The input ac source has a high output 
impedance Rhigh. The load has a low impedance Rlow. Because of the maximum 
negative feedback in a voltage follower, the closed-loop input impedance zin(CL) Operational Ampliﬁ  ers 693is incredibly high and the closed-loop output impedance zout(CL) is incredibly low. 
As a result, all the input source voltage appears across the load resistor.
The crucial point to understand is this: The voltage follower is the ideal 
interface to use between a high-impedance source and a low-impedance load . 
 Basically, it transforms the high-impedance voltage source into a low-impedance 
voltage source. You will see the voltage follower used a great deal in practice.
Since Av(CL) 5 1 in a voltage follower, the closed-loop bandwidth is 
maximum and equal to:
f2(CL) 5 funity (16-16)
Another advantage is the low output offset error because the input errors are not 
amplifi  ed. Since Av(CL) 5 1, the total output error voltage equals the worst-case 
sum of the input errors.vout vin+

Three audio signals drive the summing amplifi  er of Fig. 16-25. In this example, 
each of the input signals could represent an output from a microphone or electric 
guitar. The combined effect of this audio mixer circuit  is an output signal that 
contains the instantaneous summation of all inputs. What is the ac output voltage?
SOLUTION   The channels have closed-loop voltage gains of:
Av1(CL) 5   2100 k V ________  20 kV   5 25
Av2(CL) 5   2100 k V —  10 kV   5 210
Av3(CL) 5   2100 k V ________  50 kV   5 22694 Chapter 16
The output voltage is:
vout 5 (25)(100 mV p-p) 1 (210)(200 mV p-p) 1 (22)(300 mV p-p) 5 23.1 V p-p
Again, the negative sign indicates a 180 8 phase shift. In this circuit, Rf could be 
made a variable resistor for controlling the overall gain, and each input resistor 
could be variable to control the gain from each input.
 If it is necessary to compensate for input bias by adding an equal RB to 
the noninverting input, the resistance to use is:
RB2 5 20 k V i 10 k V i 50 k V i 100 k V 5 5.56 k V
The nearest standard value of 5.6 k V would be fi  ne. A nulling circuit would take 
care of the remaining input errors.

and the bandwidth is:

This example echoes the idea discussed earlier. The voltage follower is an easy

GOOD TO KNOW
Integrated circuits, like op amps, 
are replacing transistors in elec-
tronic circuits, just as transistors 
once replaced vacuum tubes. 
Op amps and linear ICs, how-
ever, are actually microelectronic 
circuits.Summary Table 16-2 shows the basic op-amp circuits we have discussed 
to this point.
16-6  Linear ICs
Op amps represent about a third of all linear ICs. With op amps, we can build a 
wide variety of useful circuits. Although the op amp is the most important linear 
IC, other linear ICs, such as audio amplifi  ers, video amplifi  ers, and voltage regu-
lators, are also widely used.696 Chapter 16Table of Op Amps
In Table 16-3, the prefi  x LF indicates a BIFET op amp. For instance, LF353 
is the fi  rst entry in the table. This dual BIFET op amp has a maximum input 
offset voltage of 10 mV , a maximum input bias current of 0.2 nA, and a max-
imum input offset current of 0.1 nA. It can deliver a short-circuit current of 
10 mA. It has a unity-gain frequency of 4 MHz, a slew rate of 13 V/ /H9262s, an open-
loop voltage gain of 88 dB, and a common-mode rejection ratio of 70 dB.
The table contains two more quantities not previously discussed. First, 
there is the power supply rejection ratio  (PSRR).  This quantity is defi  ned as:
PSRR  5   DVin(off) _______  DVS   (16-17)
In words, the equation says that the power-supply rejection ratio equals the change 
in the input offset voltage divided by the change in the supply voltages. In making 
this measurement, the manufacturer varies both supplies simultaneously and sym-
metrically. If VCC 5 115 V , VEE 5 215 V , and DVS 5 11 V , then VCC  becomes 
116 V and VEE becomes 216 V .
Here is what Eq. (16-17) means: Because of the imbalance in the input diff 
amp plus other internal effects, a change in the supply voltage will produce an output 
error voltage. Dividing this output error voltage by the closed-loop voltage gain gives 
the change in the input offset voltage. For instance, the LF353 of Table  16-3 has a Summary Table 16-2 Basic Op-Amp Conﬁ  gurations

*For the LM675, LM833, LM3876 and LM7171, this value is commonly expressed in microamperes.
†For the LM675 and LM3876, this value is commonly expressed in amperes.698 Chapter 16PSRR in decibels of 276 dB. When we convert this to an ordinary number,  we 
get:
PSRR 5 antilog   276 dB _______  20   5 0.000158
or, as it is sometimes written:
PSRR 5 158 /H9262V/V
This tells us that a change of 1 V in the supply voltage will produce a change in 
the input offset voltage of 158 /H9262V . Therefore, we have one more source of input 
error that joins the three input errors discussed earlier.
The last parameter shown for the LF353 is the drift of 10 /H9262V/°C. This is 
defi ned as the temperature coeffi  cient of the input offset voltage. It tells us how 
much the input offset voltage increases with temperature. A drift of 10 /H9262V/°C 
means that the input offset voltage increases 10 /H9262V for each degree increase in 
degrees Celsius. If the internal temperature of the op amp increases by 50°C, the 
input offset voltage of an LF353 increases by 500 /H9262V.
The op amps in Table 16-3 were selected to show you the variety of com-
mercially available devices. For example, the LF411A is a low-offset BIFET with 
an input offset voltage of only 0.5 mV. Most op amps are low-power devices, but 
not all. The LM675 is a high-power op amp. It has a short-circuit current of 3 A 
and can deliver 25 W to a load resistor. Even more powerful is the LM3876. It has 
a short-circuit current of 6 A and can produce a continuous load power of 56 W. 
Applications include component stereo, surround-sound amplifi  ers, and high-end 
stereo TV systems.
When you need a high slew rate, an LM318 can slew at a rate of 
70 V/ /H9262s. And then there is the LM7171, which has a slew rate of 4100 V/ /H9262s. High 
slew rate and bandwidth usually go together. As you can see, LM318 has an funity 
of 15 MHz, and the LM7171 has an funity of 200 MHz.
Many of the op amps are available as dual and quad op amps. This means 
that there are either two or four op amps in the same package. For instance, the 
LM747C is a dual 741C. The LM348 is a quad 741. The single and dual op amps 
fi t in a package with 8 pins, and the quad op amp comes in packages with 14 pins.
Not all op amps need two supply voltages. For instance, the LM324 has 
four internally compensated op amps. Although it can operate with two supplies 
like most op amps, it was specifi  cally designed for a single power supply, a defi  -
nite advantage in many applications. Another convenience of the LM324 is that 
it can work with a single power supply as low as 15 V, the standard voltage for 
many digital systems.
Internal compensation is convenient and safe because an internally com-
pensated op amp will not break into oscillations under any condition. The price 
paid for this safety is a loss of design control. This is why some op amps offer 
 external compensation. For instance, LM301A is compensated by connecting an 
external 30-pF capacitor. But the designer has the option of overcompensating 
with a larger capacitor or undercompensating with smaller capacitor. Overcom-
pensation can improve low-frequency operation, whereas undercompensation can 
increase the bandwidth and slew rate. This is why a plus sign ( 1) has been added 
to the funity and SR of the LM301A in Table 16-3.
All op amps have imperfections, as we have seen. Precision op amps try 
to minimize these imperfections. For instance, the OP-07A is a precision op amp 
with the following worst-case parameters: input offset voltage is only 0.025 mV, 
CMRR is at least 110 dB, PSRR is at least 100 dB, and drift is only 0.6 /H9262V/°C. 
Precision op amps are necessary for stringent applications such as measurement 
and control.Operational Ampliﬁ  ers 699In subsequent chapters, we will discuss more applications of op amps. 
At that time, you will see how op amps can be used in a wide variety of linear 
 circuits, nonlinear circuits, oscillators, voltage regulators, and active fi  lters.
Audio Ampliﬁ  ers
Preamplifi  ers (preamps) are audio amplifi  ers with less than 50 mW of output 
power. Preamps are optimized for low noise because they are used at the front end 
of audio systems, where they amplify weak signals from optical sensors, magnetic 
tape heads, microphones, and so on.
An example of an IC preamp is the LM833, a low-noise dual preamp. 
Each amplifi  er is completely independent of the other. The LM833 has a voltage 
gain of 110 dB and a 27-V power bandwidth of 120 kHz. The LM833’s input 
stage is a diff amp, which allows differential or single-ended input.
Medium-level audio amplifi  ers have output powers from 50 to 500 mW. 
These are useful near the output end of portable electronic devices such as cell 
phones and CD players.  An example is the LM4818 audio power amplifi  er, which 
has an output power of 350 mW.
Audio power amplifi  ers deliver more than 500 mW of output power. 
They are used in high-fi  delity amplifi  ers, intercoms, AM-FM radios, and other 
 applications. The LM380 is an example. It has a voltage gain of 34 dB, a band-
width of 100 kHz, and an output power of 2 W. As another example, the LM4756 
power amp has an internally set voltage gain of 30 dB and can deliver 7W/channel. 
Figure 16-27 shows the package style and pinout for this IC. Notice the dual offset 
pin arrangement.
Figure 16-28 shows a simplifi  ed schematic diagram of the LM380. The 
input diff amp uses pnp inputs. The signal can be directly coupled, which is an 
 advantage with transducers. The diff amp drives a current-mirror load ( Q5 and 
Q6). The output of the current mirror goes to an emitter follower ( Q7) and CE 
driver ( Q8). The output stage is a Class-B push-pull emitter follower ( Q13 and Q14). 
There is an internal compensating capacitor of 10 pF that rolls off the decibel 
voltage gain at a rate of 20 dB per decade. This capacitor produces a slew rate of 
 approximately 5 V/ /H9262s.

LM4756TA700 Chapter 16Video Ampliﬁ  ers
A video or wideband amplifi  er has a fl  at response (constant decibel voltage gain) 
over a very broad range of frequencies. Typical bandwidths are well into the meg-
ahertz region. Video amps are not necessarily dc amps, but they often do have a 
response that extends down to zero frequency. They are used in applications in 
which the range of input frequencies is very large. For instance, many analog 
oscilloscopes handle frequencies from 0 to over 100 MHz; instruments like these 
use video amps to increase the signal strength before applying it to the cathode-ray 
tube. As another example, the LM7171 is a very high-speed amplifi  er with a wide 
unity-gain bandwidth of 200 MHz and a slew rate of 4100 V/μS. This amplifi  er 
fi  nds applications in video cameras, copiers and scanners, and HDTV amplifi  ers.
IC video amps have voltage gains and bandwidths that you can adjust 
by connecting different external resistors. For instance, the NE592 has a decibel 
voltage gain of 52 dB and a cutoff frequency of 40 MHz; by changing external 
components, you can get useful gain to 90 MHz. The MC1553 has a decibel volt-
age gain of 52 dB and a bandwidth of 20 MHz; these can be adjusted by changing 
external components. The LM733 has a very wide bandwidth; it can be set up to 
give 20-dB gain and a bandwidth of 120 MHz.
RF and IF Ampliﬁ  ers
A radio-frequency (RF) amplifi  er is usually the fi  rst stage in an AM, FM, or tel-
evision receiver. Intermediate-frequency (IF) amplifi  ers typically are the middle 
stages. Some ICs include RF and IF amplifi  ers on the same chip. The amplifi  ers 
are tuned (resonant) so that they amplify only a narrow band of frequencies. This 
allows the receiver to tune a desired signal from a particular radio or television 
station. As mentioned earlier, it is impractical to integrate inductors and large 
capacitors on a chip. For this reason, you have to connect external  inductors and 
capacitors to the chip to get tuned amplifi  ers. Another example of RF ICs is the 
MBC13720. This low-noise amplifi  er is designed to operate in the 400 MHz to 
2.4 GHz range, which is where many broadband wireless applications are found.Q1Q2 Q3

Previous chapters discussed rectifi  ers and power supplies. After fi  ltering, we have 
a dc voltage with ripple. This dc voltage is proportional to the line voltage; that 
is, it will change 10 percent if the line voltage changes 10 percent. In most appli-
cations, a 10 percent change in dc voltage is too much, and voltage regulation is 
 necessary. Typical of IC voltage regulators is the LM340 series. Chips of this type 
can hold the output dc voltage to within 0.01 percent for normal changes in line 
voltage and load resistance. Other features include positive or negative output, 
 adjustable output voltage, and short-circuit protection.
16-7   Op Amps as Surface-Mount 
Devices
Operational amplifi  ers and similar kinds of analog circuits are frequently availa-
ble in surface-mount (SM) packages as well as in the more tradition dual-in-line 
IC forms. Because the pinout for most op amps tends to be relatively simple, the 
small outline package (SOP) is the preferred SM style.
For example, the LM741 op amp—the mainstay of school electronics 
labs for many years—is now available in the latest SOP package (at left). In this 
instance, the pinout of the surface-mount device (SMD) is the same as the pinout 
for the more familiar dual-in-line version.
The LM2900, a quad op amp, is an example of a more complex op-amp 
SMD package. This device is provided in a feed-through, 14-pin DIP and a 14-pin 
SOT (below). Conveniently, the pinouts are identical for the two packages.–Vin

Summary
SEC. 16-1   INTRODUCTION TO 
OP AMPS
A typical op amp has a noninverting 
input, an inverting input, and a sin-
gle-ended output. An ideal op amp has 
inﬁ nite open-loop voltage gain, inﬁ  nite 
input resistance, and zero output im-
pedance. It is a perfect ampliﬁ  er, a volt-
age-controlled voltage source (VCVS).
SEC. 16-2  THE 741 OP AMP
The 741 is a standard op amp that is 
widely used. It includes an internal 
compensating capacitor to prevent 
oscillations. With a large load resist-
ance, the output signal can swing to 
within 1 or 2  V of either supply. With 
small load resistances, MPP is limited 
by the short-circuit current. The slew 
rate is the maximum speed at which 
the output voltage can change when 
driven by a step input. The power 
bandwidth is directly proportional to 
slew rate and inversely proportional 
to the peak output voltage.
SEC. 16-3   THE INVERTING 
AMPLIFIER
The inverting ampliﬁ  er is the most 
basic op-amp circuit. It uses negative feedback to stabilize the closed-loop 
voltage gain. The inverting input is a 
virtual ground because it is a short 
for voltage but an open for current. 
The closed-loop voltage gain equals 
the feedback resistance divided by 
the input resistance. The closed-loop 
bandwidth equals the unity-gain fre-
quency divided by the closed-loop 
voltage gain.
SEC. 16-4   THE NONINVERTING 
AMPLIFIER
The noninverting ampliﬁ  er is another 
basic op-amp circuit. It uses negative 
feedback to stabilize the closed-
loop voltage gain. A virtual short is 
between the noninverting input and 
the inverting input. The closed-loop 
voltage gain equals Rf/R1 1 1. The 
closed-loop bandwidth equals the 
unity-gain frequency divided by the 
closed-loop voltage gain.
SEC. 16-5   TWO OP-AMP 
APPLICATIONS
The summing ampliﬁ  er has two or 
more inputs and one output. Each 
input is ampliﬁ  ed by its channel 
gain. The output is the sum of the ampliﬁ  ed inputs. If all channel gains 
equal unity, the output equals the 
sum of the inputs. In a mixer, a 
summing ampliﬁ  er can amplify and 
combine audio signals. A voltage 
follower has a closed-loop voltage 
gain of unity and a bandwidth of 
funity. The circuit is useful as an in-
terface between a high-impedance 
source and a low-impedance load.
SEC. 16-6  LINEAR ICS
Op amps represent about a third of 
all linear ICs. A wide variety of op 
amps exists for almost any appli-
cation. Some have very low input 
off sets, others have high bandwidths 
and slew rates, and others have low 
drifts. Dual and quad op amps are 
available. Even high-power op amps 
exist that can produce large load 
power. Other linear ICs include audio 
and video ampliﬁ  ers, RF and IF ampli-
ﬁ  ers, and voltage regulators.

In August 1927, a young engineer named Harold Black took a 
ferry from Staten Island, New York, to work. To pass the time on 
that summer morning, he jotted down some equations about 
a new idea. During the next few months, he polished the idea 
and then applied for a patent. But as so often happens with a 
truly new idea, it was ridiculed. The patent offi   ce rejected his 
application and classiﬁ  ed it as another one of those “perpetual-
motion follies.” But only for a while. Black’s idea was negative 
feedback.

Feedback
Black invented only one type of negative feedback,  the kind that stabilizes the 
voltage gain, increases the input impedance, and decreases the output impedance. 
With the advent of transistors and op amps, three more kinds of negative feedback 
became available.
Basic Ideas
The input to a negative-feedback amplifi  er can be either a voltage or a current. 
Also, the output signal can be either a voltage or a current. This implies that four 
types of negative feedback exist. As shown in Summary Table 17-1, the fi  rst type 
has an input voltage and an output voltage. The circuit that uses this type of neg-
ative feedback is called a voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS).  A VCVS 
is an ideal voltage amplifi  er because it has a stabilized voltage gain, infi  nite input 
 impedance, and zero output impedance as shown.
 In the second type of negative feedback, an input current controls an out-
put voltage. The circuit using this type of feedback is called a current- controlled 
voltage source (ICVS).  Because an input current controls an output voltage, an 
ICVS is sometimes called a transresistance amplifi  er. The word resistance  is 
used because the ratio of vout/iin has the unit of ohms. The prefi  x trans  refers to 
taking the ratio of an output quantity to an input quantity.
 The third type of negative feedback has an input voltage controlling an 
output current. The circuit using this type of negative feedback is called a voltage-
controlled current source (VCIS).  Because an input voltage controls an output 
current, a VCIS is sometimes called a transconductance amplifi  er. The word 
conductance  is used because the ratio of iout/vin has the unit of siemens (mhos). 
 In the fourth type of negative feedback, an input current is amplifi  ed to get 
a larger output current. The circuit with this type of negative feedback is called a cur-
rent-controlled current source (ICIS).  An ICIS is an ideal current amplifi  er because 
it has a stabilized current gain, zero input impedance, and infi  nite  output impedance.
Converters
Referring to VCVS and ICIS circuits as amplifi  ers makes sense because the fi  rst 
is a voltage amplifi  er and the second is a current amplifi  er. But the use of the word 
amplifi  er  with transconductance and transresistance amplifi  ers may seem a bit 
odd at fi  rst because the input and output quantities are different. Because of this, 
many engineers and technicians prefer to think of these circuits as converters. For 
instance, the VCIS is also called a voltage-to-current converter.  You put volts in, 
and you get amperes out. Similarly, the ICVS is also called a current-to- voltage 
converter.  Current goes in, and voltage comes out.

Figure 17-1 a shows the VCVS, a voltage amplifi  er. With practical circuits, the 
input impedance is not infi  nite, but it is very high. Likewise, the output impedance 
is not zero, but it is very low. The voltage gain of the VCVS is symbolized Av. 
Since zout approaches zero, the output side of a VCVS is a stiff voltage source to 
any practical load resistance.
 Figure 17-1 b shows an ICVS, a transresistance amplifi  er (current-to- 
voltage converter). It has a very low input impedance and a very low output imped-
ance. The conversion factor of the ICVS is called transresistance,  symbolized rm
and expressed in ohms. For instance, if rm 5 1 kV, an input current of 1 mA will 
produce a constant voltage of 1 V across the load. Because zout approaches zero, the 
output side of an ICVS is a stiff voltage source for practical load resistances.
 Figure 17-2 a shows a VCIS, a transconductance amplifi  er (volt-
age-to-current converter). It has a very high input impedance and a very high 
output  impedance. The conversion factor of the VCIS is called transconductance,
symbolized gm and expressed in siemens (mhos). For instance, if gm 5 1 mS, an 
input voltage of 1 V will pump a current of 1 mA through the load. Because zout
 approaches infi  nity, the output side of a VCIS is a stiff current source for any 
practical load resistance.
 Figure 17-2 b shows an ICIS, a current amplifi  er. It has very low input 
impedance and very high output impedance. The current gain of the ICIS is sym-
bolized Ai. Since zout approaches infi  nity, the output side of a VCVS is a stiff 
 current source to any practical load resistance.
17-2   VCVS Voltage Gain
In Chap. 16, we analyzed the noninverting amplifi  er, a widely used implemen-
tation  (circuit realization) of a VCVS. In this section, we want to reexamine the 
noninverting amplifi  er and delve more deeply into its voltage gain.LOW zout

Figure 17-3 shows a noninverting amplifi  er. The op amp has an open-loop voltage 
gain of AVOL, typically 100,000 or more. Because of the voltage divider, part of 
the output voltage is fed back to the inverting input. The feedback fraction B of 
any VCVS circuit is defi  ned as feedback voltage divided by the output voltage. 
In Fig. 17-3:
B 5   v2 — vout   (17-1)
The feedback fraction is also called the feedback attenuation factor  because it 
indicates how much the output voltage is attenuated before the feedback signal 
reaches the inverting input.
With some algebra, we can derive the following exact equation for the 
closed-loop voltage gain:
Av(CL) 5   AVOL __________  1 1 AVOL B   (17-2)
or with the notation of Summary Table 17-1, where Av 5 Av(CL):
Av 5   AVOL __________  1 1 AVOL B   (17-3)
This is the exact equation for the closed-loop voltage gain of any VCVS amplifi  er.
Loop Gain
The second term in the denominator, AVOLB, is called the loop gain  because it is 
the voltage gain of the forward and feedback paths. The loop gain is a very impor-
tant value in the design of a negative-feedback amplifi  er. In any practical design, 
the loop gain is made very large. The larger the loop gain, the better, because it 
stabilizes the voltage gain and has an enhancing or curative effect on quantities 
such as gain stability, distortion, offsets, input impedance, and output impedance.
Ideal Closed-Loop Voltage Gain
For a VCVS to work well, the loop gain AVOLB must be much greater than unity. 
When the designer satisfi  es this condition, Eq. (17-3) becomes:
Av 5   AVOL __________  1 1 AVOL B   >   AVOL ______ AVOL B  
or

R1Rfvin+
–Figure 17-3  VCVS ampliﬁ  er.Negative Feedback 715This ideal equation gives almost exact answers when AVOLB .. 1. The exact 
closed-loop voltage gain is slightly less than this ideal closed-loop voltage gain. 
If necessary, we can calculate the percent error between the ideal and exact values 
with:
% Error  5   100% __________  1 1 AVOLB   (17-5)
For instance, if 1 1 AVOLB is 1000 (60 dB), the error is only 0.1 percent. This 
means that the exact answer is only 0.1 percent less than the ideal answer.
Using the Ideal Equation
Equation (17-4) can be used to calculate the ideal closed-loop voltage gain of any 
VCVS amplifi  er. All you have to do is calculate the feedback fraction with Eq. (17-
1) and take the reciprocal. For instance, in Fig. 17-3, the feedback fraction is:

Taking the reciprocal gives:

Except for replacing Av(CL) with Av, this is the same formula derived in Chap. 16 
with a virtual short between the input terminals of the op amp.
Application Example 17-1
In Fig. 17-4, calculate the feedback fraction, the ideal closed-loop voltage gain, 
the percent error, and the exact closed-loop voltage gain. Use a typical AVOL of

Negative feedback has a curative effect on the fl  aws or shortcomings of an ampli-
fi er, whether it is made up of ICs or discrete components. For instance, the open-
loop voltage gain may have wide variations from one op amp to the next. Negative 
feedback stabilizes  the voltage gain; that is, it almost eliminates the internal op-
amp variations and makes the closed-loop voltage gain dependent primarily on 
external resistances. Since these resistances can be precision resistors with very 
low temperature coeffi  cients, the closed-loop voltage gain becomes ultrastable.
 Similarly, negative feedback in a VCVS amplifi  er increases the input im-
pedance, decreases the output impedance, and reduces any nonlinear distortion of 
the amplifi  ed signal. In this section, we will fi  nd out just how much improvement 
occurs with negative feedback.
Gain Stability
The gain stability depends on having a very low percent error between the ideal 
and the exact closed-loop voltage gains. The smaller the percent error, the better 
the stability. The worst-case error  of closed-loop voltage gain occurs when the 
open-loop voltage gain is minimum. As an equation:
% Maximum error  5   100% _____________   1 1 AVOL (min)B   (17-7)
With Eq. (17-5), the percent error is:
% Error 5   100% _________  1 1 AVOLB   5   100%  __________________   1 1 (100,000)(0.025)   5 0.04%
We can calculate the exact closed-loop voltage gain in either of two ways: We can 
reduce the ideal answer by 0.04 percent, or we can use the exact formula, Eq. (17-
3). Here are the calculations for both approaches:
Av 5 40 2 (0.04%)(40) 5 40 2 (0.0004)(40) 5 39.984
This unrounded-off answer allows us to see how close the ideal answer (40) is to 
the exact answer. We can get the same exact answer with Eq. (17-3):
Av 5   AVOL _________  1 1 AVOLB   5   100,000  __________________   1 1 (100,000)(0.025)   5 39.984
 In conclusion, this example has demonstrated the accuracy of the ideal 
equation for closed-loop voltage gain. Except for the most stringent analysis, we 
can always use the ideal equation. In those rare cases when we need to know how 
much error exists, we can fall back on Eq. (17-5) to calculate the percent error.
 This example also validates the use of a virtual short between the input 
terminals of an op amp. In more complicated circuits, the virtual short allows us 
to analyze the effect of feedback with logical methods based on Ohm’s law rather 
than having to derive more equations.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 17-1   In Fig. 17-4, change the feedback resistor 
from 3.9 k V to 4.9 k V. Calculate the feedback fraction, the ideal closed-loop 
voltage gain, the percent error, and the exact closed-loop gain.
GOOD TO KNOW
Basically, any op-amp circuit that 
does not use negative feedback 
is considered too unstable to be 
useful.Negative Feedback 717where AVOL(min) is the minimum or worst-case open-loop voltage gain shown on a 
data sheet. With a 741C, AVOL(min) 5 20,000.
 For instance, if 1 1 AVOL(min)B 5 500:
% Maximum error 5   100% — 500   5 0.2%
In mass production, the closed-loop voltage gain of any VCVS amplifi  er with the 
foregoing numbers will be within 0.2 percent of the ideal value.
Closed-Loop Input Impedance
Figure 17-5 a shows a noninverting amplifi  er. Here is the exact equation for the 
closed-loop input impedance of this VCVS amplifi  er:
zin(CL) 5 (1 1 AVOLB)Rin /H20648 RCM (17-8)
where Rin 5 the open-loop input resistance of the op amp
RCM 5  the common-mode input resistance of the op amp
A word or two about the resistances that appear in this equation: First, Rin is the 
input resistance shown on a data sheet. In a discrete bipolar diff amp, it equals 
2/H9252re9, discussed in Chap.  15. We also discussed Rin, and Summary Table 16-1 
listed an input resistance of 2 M V for a 741C.

kHzFigure 17-5  (a) VCVS ampliﬁ  er; ( b) nonlinear distortion; ( c) fundamental and harmonics.718 Chapter 17 Second, RCM is the equivalent tail resistance of the input diff-amp stage. 
In a discrete bipolar diff amp, RCM equals RE. In op amps, a current mirror is used 
in place of RE. Because of this, the RCM of an op amp has an extremely high value. 
For instance, a 741C has an RCM that is greater than 100 M V.
 Often, RCM is ignored because it is large, and Eq. (17-8) is approxi-
mated by:
zin(CL) /H11061 (1 1 AVOLB)Rin (17-9)
Since 1 1 AVOLB is much greater than unity in a practical VCVS amplifi  er, the 
closed-input impedance is extremely high. In a voltage follower, B is 1 and zin(CL) 
would approach infi  nity, except for the parallel effect of RCM in Eq. (17-8). In 
other words, the ultimate limit on the closed-loop input impedance is:
zin(CL) 5 RCM
 The main point to get is this: The exact value of closed-loop input im-
pedance is not important. What is important is that it is very large, usually much 
larger than Rin but less than the ultimate limit of  RCM.
Closed-Loop Output Impedance
In Fig. 17-5 a, the closed-loop output impedance is the overall output impedance 
looking back into the VCVS amplifi  er. The exact equation for this closed-loop 
output impedance is:
zout(CL) 5   Rout —  1 1 AVOLB   (17-10)
where Rout is the open-loop output resistance of the op amp shown on a data sheet. 
We discussed Rout, and Summary Table 16-1 listed an output resistance of 75 V 
for a 741C.
 Since 1 1 AVOLB is much greater than unity in a practical VCVS ampli-
fi er, the closed-loop output impedance is less than 1 V and may even approach zero 
in a voltage follower. For a voltage follower, the closed-loop impedance is so low 
that the resistance of the connecting wires may become the limiting factor.
 Again, the main point is not the exact value of closed-loop output imped-
ance but, rather, the fact that VCVS negative feedback reduces it to values much 
smaller than 1 V. For this reason, the output side of a VCVS amplifi  er approaches 
an ideal voltage source.
Nonlinear Distortion
One more improvement worth mentioning is the effect of negative feedback on 
distortion. In the later stages of an amplifi  er, nonlinear distortion  will occur with 
large signals because the input/output response of the amplifying devices becomes 
nonlinear. For instance, the nonlinear graph of the base-emitter diode distorts a 
large signal by elongating the positive half-cycle and compressing the negative 
half-cycle, as shown in Fig. 17-5 b.
 Nonlinear distortion produces harmonics  of the input signal. For in-
stance, if a sinusoidal voltage signal has a frequency of 1 kHz, the distorted out-
put current will contain sinusoidal signals with frequencies of 1, 2, 3 kHz, and 
so forth, as shown in the spectrum diagram  of Fig. 17-5 c. The fundamental fre-
quency is 1 kHz, and all others are harmonics. The rms value of all the harmonics 
measured together tells us how much distortion has occurred. This is why non-
linear distortion is often called harmonic distortion.
 We can measure harmonic distortion with an instrument called a distor-
tion analyzer.  This instrument measures the total harmonic voltage and divides Negative Feedback 719it by the fundamental voltage to get the percent of total harmonic distortion,
 defi ned as:
THD  5   Total harmonic voltage   ____________________   Fundamental voltage   3 100%  (17-11)
For instance, if the total harmonic voltage is 0.1 V rms and the fundamental voltage 
is 1 V , then THD  5 10 percent.
 Negative feedback reduces harmonic distortion. The exact equation for 
closed-loop harmonic distortion is:
THD CL 5   THD OL __________  1 1 AVOLB   (17-12)
where THD OL 5 open-loop harmonic distortion
THD CL 5 closed-loop harmonic distortion
Once again, the quantity 1 1 AVOLB has a curative effect. When it is large, it re-
duces the harmonic distortion to negligible levels. In stereo amplifi  er systems, this 
means that we hear high-fi  delity music instead of distorted sounds.
Discrete Negative Feedback Ampliﬁ  er
The idea of a voltage amplifi  er (VCVS), whose voltage gain is controlled by 
 external resistors, was briefl  y described in Chap. 9. The discrete two-stage feed-
back amplifi  er, shown in Fig. 9-4, is essentially a noninverting voltage amplifi  er 
using negative feedback.
 Looking back at this circuit, the two CE stages produce an open-loop 
voltage gain equal to:
AVOL 5 (Av1)(Av2)
The output voltage drives a voltage divider formed by rf and re. Because the 
 bottom of re is at ac ground, the feedback fraction is approximately:
B >   re ______ re 1 rf  
This ignores the loading effect of the input transistor’s emitter.
 The input vin drives the base of the fi  rst transistor, while the feedback 
voltage drives the emitter. An error voltage appears across the base-emitter diode. 
The mathematical analysis is similar to that given earlier. The closed-loop  voltage
gain is approximately   1 __ B  , the input impedance is (1 1 AVOLB)Rin, the output
 impedance is   Rout ——  (1 1 AVOLB)  , and the distortion is   THD OL ___________  (1 1 AVOLB)  . It is very common
to fi  nd the use of negative feedback in a variety of discrete amplifi  er confi  gurations.
Example 17-2
In Fig. 17-6, the 741C has an Rin of 2 M V and an RCM of 200 M V. What is the 
closed-loop input impedance? Use a typical AVOL of 100,000 for the 741C.
SOLUTION   In Application Example 17-1, we calculated B 5 0.025. 
Therefore:
1 1 AVOLB 5 1 1 (100,000)(0.025) > 2500
With Eq. (17-9):
zin(CL) > (1 1 AVOLB)Rin 5 (2500)(2 M V) 5 5000 M V720 Chapter 17
Whenever you get an answer over 100 M V, Eq. (17-8) should be used. With 
Eq. (17-8):
zin(CL) 5 (5000 M V) i 200 M V 5 192 M V
This high input impedance means that a VCVS approaches an ideal voltage 
 amplifi  er.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 17-2   In Fig. 17-6, change the 3.9-k V resistor to 
4.9 k V and solve for zin(CL).
Example 17-3
Use the data and results of the preceding example to calculate the closed-loop 
output impedance in Fig. 17-6. Use an AVOL of 100,000 and Rout of 75 V.
SOLUTION   With Eq. (17-10):
zout(CL) 5   75 V — 2500   5 0.03 V
This low output impedance means that a VCVS approaches an ideal voltage 
 amplifi  er.

Figure 17-7 shows a transresistance amplifi  er. It has an input current and an 
output voltage. The ICVS amplifi  er is an almost perfect current-to-voltage 
 converter  because it has zero input impedance and zero output impedance.
Output Voltage
The exact equation for output voltage is:
vout 5 2  ( iinRf   AVOL ________  1 1 AVOL   )   (17-13)
Because AVOL is much greater than unity, the equation simplifi  es to:
vout 5 2(iinRf) (17-14)
where Rf is the transresistance.
 An easy way to derive and remember Eq. (17-14) is to use the concept 
of a virtual ground. Remember, the inverting input is a virtual ground to voltage, 
not current. When you visualize a virtual ground on the inverting input, you can 
see that all of the input current must fl  ow through the feedback resistor. Since 
the left end of this resistor is grounded, the magnitude of the output voltage is 
given by:
vout 5 2(iinRf)
 The circuit is a current-to-voltage converter. We can select different 
 values of Rf to get different conversion factors (transresistances). For instance, if 
Rf 5 1 kV, then an input of 1 mA produces an output of 1 V . If Rf 5 10 k V, the 
same input current produces an output of 10 V . The current direction shown in 
Fig. 17-8 is conventional current fl  ow.

The Inverting Ampliﬁ  er
In a previous chapter, we discussed the inverting amplifi  er of Fig. 17-8. Recall that 
it has a closed-loop voltage gain of:
Av 5   2Rf ____ R1   (17-17)
This type of amplifi  er uses ICVS negative feedback. Because of the virtual ground 
on the inverting input, the input current equals:
iin 5   vin ___ R1  
Example 17-5
In Fig. 17-9, what is the output voltage if the input frequency is 1 kHz?
SOLUTION   Visualize the input current of 1 mA p-p fl  owing through the 5-k V 
resistor. With either Ohm’s law or Eq. (17-14):
vout 5 2 (1 mA p-p)(5 k V) 5 2 5 V p-p
Again, the negative sign indicates a 180° phase shift. The output voltage is an ac 
voltage with a peak-to-peak value of 5 V and a frequency of 1 kHz.

With a VCIS amplifi  er, an input voltage controls an output current. Because of the 
heavy negative feedback in this kind of amplifi  er, the input voltage is converted to 
a precise value of output current.
 Figure 17-10 shows a transconductance amplifi  er. It is similar to a VCVS 
amplifi  er, except that RL is the load resistor as well as the feedback resistor. In 
other words, the active output is not the voltage across R1 1 RL; rather, it is the 
current through RL. This output current is stabilized; that is, a specifi  c value of 
input voltage produces a precise value of output current.
 In Fig. 17-10, the exact equation for output current is:

zout(CL) 5   75 V ___________  1 1 100,000   >   75 V _______ 100,000   5 0.00075 V
PRACTICE PROBLEM 17-6   Repeat Example 17-6 with AVOL 5 200,000.724 Chapter 17In a practical circuit, the second term in the denominator is much smaller than the 
fi  rst, and the equation simplifi  es to:
iout 5   vin ___ R1   (17-19)
This is sometimes written as:
iout 5 gmvin
where gm 5 1/R1.
 Here is an easy way to derive and remember Eq. (17-19): When you 
 visualize a virtual short between the input terminals of Fig. 17-10, the inverting 
input is bootstrapped to the noninverting input. Therefore, all the input voltage 
 appears a cross R1. The current through this resistor is:
i1 5   vin ___ R1  
In Fig. 17-10, the only path for this current is through RL. This is why Eq. (17-19) 
gives the value of output current.
 The circuit is a voltage-to-current converter.  We can select different 
 values of R1 to get different conversion factors (transconductances). For instance, 
if R1 5 1 kV, an input voltage of 1 V produces an output current of 1 mA. If 
R1 5 100 V, the same input voltage produces an output current of 10 mA.
 Since the input side of Fig. 17-10 is the same as the input side of a 
VCVS amplifi  er, the approximate equation for the closed-loop input impedance 
of a VCIS amplifi  er is:
zin(CL) 5 (1 1 AVOLB)Rin (17-20)
where Rin is the input resistance of the op amp. The stabilized output current sees 
a closed-loop output impedance of:
zout(CL) 5 (1 1 AVOL)R1 (17-21)
In both equations, a large AVOL increases both impedances toward infi  nity, ex-
actly what we want for a VCIS amplifi  er. The circuit is an almost perfect volt-
age-to-current converter because it has very high input and output impedances.
 The transconductance amplifi  er of Fig. 17-10 operates with a fl  oating 
load resistor. This is not always convenient because many loads are single-ended. 
In this case, you may see linear ICs, such as the LM13600 and LM13700, used as 
transconductance amplifi  ers. These monolithic transconductance amplifi  ers can 
drive a single-ended load resistance.
Example 17-7
What is the load current in Fig. 17-11? The load power? What happens if the load 
resistance changes to 4 V?
SOLUTION   Visualize a virtual short across the input terminals of the op 
amp. With the inverting input bootstrapped to the noninverting input, all the input 
voltage is across the 1- V resistor. With Ohm’s law or Eq. (17-19), we can calcu-
late an output current of:
iout 5   2 V rms ______ 1 V   5 2 A rms
This 2 A fl  ows through the load resistance of 2 V, producing a load power:
PL 5 (2 A)2(2 V) 5 8 WNegative Feedback 72517-6  The ICIS Ampliﬁ  er
An ICIS circuit amplifi  es the input current. Because of the heavy negative feed-
back, the ICIS amplifi  er tends to act like a perfect current amplifi  er. It has a very 
low input impedance and a very high output impedance.
 Figure 17-12 shows an inverting current amplifi  er. The closed-loop cur-
rent gain is stabilized and given by:
Ai 5   AVOL(R1 1 R2)  ——   RL 1 AVOLR1   (17-22)
 If the load resistance is changed to 4 V, the output current is still 2 A rms, 
but the load power increases to:
PL 5 (2 A)2(4 V) 5 16 W
As long as the op amp does not saturate, we can change the load resistance to any 
value and still have a stabilized output current of 2 A rms.

–15 VNegative Feedback 72717-7 Bandwidth
Negative feedback increases the bandwidth of an amplifi  er because the roll-off in 
open-loop voltage gain means that less voltage is fed back, which produces more 
input voltage as a compensation. Because of this, the closed-loop cutoff frequency 
is higher than the open-loop cutoff frequency.
Closed-Loop Bandwidth
As discussed in a previous chapter, recall that the closed-loop cutoff bandwidth 
is given by:
f2(CL) 5   funity _____ Av(CL)   (17-27)
We can also derive two more VCVS equations for closed-loop bandwidth:
f2(CL) 5 (1 1 AVOLB)f2(OL) (17-28)
f2(CL) 5   AVOL _____ Av(CL)    f2(OL) (17-29)
where Av(CL) is the same as Av.
 You can use any of these equations to calculate the closed-loop band-
width of a VCVS amplifi  er. The one to use depends on the given data. For in-
stance, if you know the values of funity and Av(CL), then Eq. (17-27) is the one to 
use. If you have the values of AVOL, B, and f2(OL), use Eq. (17-28). Sometimes, you 
know the values of AVOL, Av(CL), and f2(OL). In this case, Eq. (17-29) is useful.
Gain-Bandwidth Product Is Constant
Equation (17-27) can be rewritten as:
Av(CL)f2(CL) 5 funity
The left side of this equation is the product of gain and bandwidth, and is called the 
gain-bandwidth product (GBP).  The right side of the equation is a constant for 
a given op amp. In words, the equation says that the gain-bandwidth product is a 
constant.  Because GBP is a constant for a given op amp, a designer has to trade off 
gain for bandwidth. The less gain used, the more bandwidth results. Conversely, if 
the designer wants more gain, he or she has to settle for less bandwidth.
 The only way to improve matters is to use an op amp with a higher GBP, 
equivalent to a higher funity. If an op amp does not have enough GBP for an appli-
cation, a designer can select a better op amp, one with a greater GBP. For instance, 
a 741C has a GBP of 1 MHz. If this is too low for a given application, we can use 
an LM318 which has a GBP of 15 MHz. This way, we would get 15 times as much 
bandwidth for the same closed-loop voltage gain.
If the load resistance is increased to 2 V, the load current is still 1.5 A rms, but the 
load power increases to:
PL 5 (1.5 A)2(2 V) 5 4.5 W
PRACTICE PROBLEM 17-8   Using Fig. 17-13, change iin to 2 mA. 
 Calculate iout and PL.728 Chapter 17Bandwidth and Slew-Rate Distortion
Although negative feedback reduces the nonlinear distortion of the later stages of 
an amplifi  er, it has absolutely no effect on slew-rate distortion. Therefore, after you 
calculate the closed-loop bandwidth, you can calculate the power bandwidth with 
Eq. (16-2). For an undistorted output over the entire closed-loop bandwidth, the 
closed-loop cutoff frequency must be less than the power bandwidth:
f2(CL)  fmax (17-30)
This means that the peak value of the output should be less than:
Vp(max) 5   SR — 2pf2(CL)   (17-31)
 Here is why negative feedback has no effect on slew-rate distortion: The 
internal compensating capacitor of an op amp produces a large-input Miller ca-
pacitance. For a 741C, this large capacitance loads down the input diff amp, as 
shown in Fig. 17-14 a. When slew-rate distortion occurs, vin is high enough to 
saturate one transistor and cut off the other. Since the op amp is no longer oper-
ating in the linear region, the curative effect of negative feedback is temporarily 
suspended.
 Figure 17-14 b shows what happens when Q1 is saturated and Q2 is cut 
off. Since the 3000-pF capacitor must charge through a 1-M V resistor, we get the 
slew shown in the fi  gure. After the capacitor charges, Q1 comes out of saturation, 
Q2 comes out of cutoff, and the curative effect of negative feedback reappears.

Summary
SEC. 17-1   FOUR TYPES OF 
 NEGATIVE FEEDBACK
There are four ideal types of neg-
ative feedback: VCVS, ICVS, VCIS, 
and ICIS. Two types (VCVS and VCIS) 
are controlled by an input voltage, 
and the other two types (ICVS and 
ICIS) are controlled by an input cur-
rent. The output sides of VCVS and 
ICVS act like a voltage source, and 
the output sides of VCIS and ICIS act 
like a current source.
SEC. 17-2   VCVS VOLTAGE GAIN
The loop gain is the voltage gain of 
the forward and feedback paths. In 
any practical design, the loop gain is 
very large. As a result, the closed-loop 
voltage gain is ultrastable because 
it no longer depends on the char-
acteristics of the ampliﬁ  er. Instead, it 
depends almost entirely on the char-
acteristics of external resistors.SEC. 17-3   OTHER VCVS 
EQUATIONS
VCVS negative feedback has a cura-
tive eff  ect on the ﬂ  aws of an ampliﬁ  er 
because it stabilizes the voltage gain, 
increases the input impedance, de-
creases the output impedance, and 
decreases harmonic distortion.
SEC. 17-4   THE ICVS AMPLIFIER
This is a transresistance ampliﬁ  er, 
equivalent to a current-to-voltage 
converter. Because of the virtual 
ground, it ideally has zero input im-
pedance. The input current produces 
a precise value of output voltage.
SEC. 17-5   THE VCIS AMPLIFIER
This is a transconductance ampli-
ﬁ  er, equivalent to a voltage-to-cur-
rent converter. It ideally has inﬁ  nite 
input impedance. The input voltage produces a precise value of output 
current. The output impedance ap-
proaches inﬁ  nity.
SEC. 17-6   THE ICIS AMPLIFIER
Because of the heavy negative feed-
back, the ICIS ampliﬁ  er approaches 
the perfect current ampliﬁ  er, one with 
zero input impedance and inﬁ  nite 
output impedance.
SEC. 17-7   BANDWIDTH
Negative feedback increases the 
bandwidth of an ampliﬁ  er because 
the roll-off   in open-loop voltage gain 
means that less voltage is fed back, 
which produces more input voltage 
as a compensation. Because of this, 
the closed-loop cutoff   frequency 
is higher than the open-loop cutoff   
frequency.

The output of a linear op-amp circuit  has the same shape 
as the input signal.  If the input is sinusoidal, the output is 
sinusoidal. At no time during the cycle does the op amp go into 
saturation. This chapter discusses a variety of linear op-amp 
circuit applications including inverting ampliﬁ  ers, noninverting 
ampliﬁ  ers, diff  erential ampliﬁ  ers, instrumentation ampliﬁ  ers, 
current boosters, controlled current sources, and automatic gain

In this chapter and succeeding chapters, we will be discussing many different 
types of op-amp circuits. Instead of providing a summary page showing all of the 
circuits, small summary boxes will be given containing the important formulas 
for circuit understanding. Also, where needed, the feedback resistor Rf will be 
 labeled a s R, R2, or other designations.
 The inverting amplifi  er is one of the most basic circuits. Previous chap-
ters have discussed the prototype for this amplifi  er. One advantage of this ampli-
fi er is that its voltage gain equals the ratio of the feedback resistance to the input 
resistance. Let us look at a few applications.
High-Impedance Probe
Figure 18-1 shows a high-impedance probe that can be used with a digital mul-
timeter. Because of the virtual ground in the fi  rst stage, the probe has an input 
 impedance of 100 M V at low frequencies. The fi  rst stage is an inverting amplifi  er 
with a voltage gain of 0.1. The second stage is an inverting amplifi  er with a volt-
age gain of either 1 or 10.
 The circuit of Fig. 18-1 gives you the basic idea of the 10 ;1 probe. It has 
a very high input impedance and an overall voltage gain of either 0.1 or 1. In the 
X10 position of the switch, the output signal is attenuated by a factor of 10. In the 
X1 position, there is no attenuation of the output signal. The basic circuit shown 
here can be improved by adding more components to increase the bandwidth.
AC-Coupled Ampliﬁ  er
In some applications, you do not need a response that extends down to zero fre-
quency because only ac signals drive the input. Figure 18-2 shows an ac-coupled 
amplifi  er and its equations. The voltage gain is shown as:
Av 5   2Rf ____ R1

cutoff frequencies fc1. For the values shown:

cutoff frequency  fc2:

Adjustable-Bandwidth Circuit
Sometimes we would like to change the closed-loop bandwidth of an inverting 
voltage amplifi  er without changing the closed-loop voltage gain. Figure 18-3 
shows one way to do it. When R is varied, the bandwidth will change but the volt-
age gain will remain constant.Figure 18-2   AC-coupled inverting ampliﬁ  er.

f2(CL)min 5 (0.001)(1 MHz) 5 1 kHz
f2(CL)max 5 (0.05)(1 MHz) 5 50 kHz
In summary, when R varies from 100 V to 10 k V, the voltage gain remains con-
stant but the bandwidth varies from 1 to 50 kHz.
18-2   Noninverting-Ampliﬁ  er 
Circuits
The noninverting amplifi  er is another basic op-amp circuit. Advantages include 
stable voltage gain, high input impedance, and low output impedance. Here are 
some applications.
AC-Coupled Ampliﬁ  er
Figure 18-4 shows an ac-coupled noninverting amplifi  er and its analysis equa-
tions. C1 and C2 are coupling capacitors. C3 is a bypass capacitor. Using a 
bypass capacitor has the advantage of minimizing the output offset voltage. 
Here’s why: In the midband of the amplifi  er, the bypass capacitor has a very

feedback fraction is:
B 5   R1 _______ R1 1 Rf   (18-1)
In this case, the circuit amplifi  es the input voltage as previously described.
 When the frequency is zero, the bypass capacitor C3 is open and the 
feedback fraction B increases to unity because:
B 5   ` ______ ` 1 1  5 1
This equation is valid if we defi  ne ` as an extremely large value, which is what 
the impedance equals at zero frequency. With B equal to 1, the closed-loop voltage 
gain is unity. This reduces the output offset voltage to a minimum.
 With values given in Fig. 18-4, we can calculate the midband voltage 
gain as:
Av 5   100 k V _______ 1 kV   1 1 5 101
If funity is 15 MHz, the bandwidth is:
f2(CL) 5   15 MHz _______  101   5 149 kHz
The input coupling capacitor produces a cutoff frequency of:
fc1 5   1 ——   2/H9266(100 k V)(1 /H9262F)   5 1.59 Hz
Similarly, the output coupling capacitor C2 and the load resistance RL produce a 
cutoff frequency  fc2:
fc2 5   1 _______________   2/H9266(10 k V)(1 /H9262F)   5 15.9 Hz
The bypass capacitor produces a cutoff frequency of:
fc3 5   1 ______________   2/H9266(1 kV)(1 /H9262F)   5 159 Hz
Audio Distribution Ampliﬁ  er
Figure 18-5 shows an ac-coupled noninverting amplifi  er driving three voltage fol-
lowers. This is one way to distribute an audio signal to several different outputs. 
The closed-loop voltage gain and bandwidth of the fi  rst stage are given by the 
familiar equations shown in Fig. 18-5. For the values shown, the closed-loop volt-
age gain is 40. If funity is 1 MHz, the closed-loop bandwidth is 25 kHz.
 Incidentally, an op amp like an LM348 is convenient to use in a circuit 
like Fig. 18-5 because the LM348 is a quad 741—four 741s in a 14-pin pack-
age. One of the op amps can be the fi  rst stage, and the others can be the voltage 
followers.
JFET-Switched Voltage Gain
Some applications require a change in closed-loop voltage gain. Figure 18-6 
shows a noninverting amplifi  er whose voltage gain is controlled by a JFET that 
acts like a switch. The input voltage to the JFET is a two-state voltage, either zero 
or VGS(off). When the control voltage is low, it equals VGS(off) and the JFET is open. 746 Chapter 18–+

In this case, R2 is ungrounded and the voltage gain is given by the usual equation 
for a noninverting amplifi  er (the top equation in Fig. 18-6).
 When the control voltage is high, it equals 0 V and the JFET switch 
is  closed. This puts R2 in parallel with R1, and the closed-loop voltage gain 
 decreases to:
Av 5   Rf ______ R1 /H20648 R2   1 1 (18-2)
In most designs, R2 is made much larger than rds(on) to prevent the JFET resistance 
from affecting the closed-loop voltage gain. Sometimes, you may see several re-
sistors and JFET switches in parallel with R1 to provide a selection of different 
voltage gains.Linear Op-Amp Circuit Applications 747Voltage Reference
The MC1403 is a special-function IC called a voltage reference,  a circuit that 
produces an extremely accurate and stable output voltage. For any positive supply 
voltage between 4.5 and 40 V , it produces an output voltage of 2.5 V with a toler-
ance of 61 percent. The temperature coeffi  cient is only 10 ppm/°C. The abbrevi-
ation ppm stands for “parts per million” (1 ppm is equivalent to 0.0001 percent). 
Therefore, 10 ppm/°C produces a change of only 2.5 mV for a 100°C change in 
temperature (10 3 0.0001 percent 3 100 3 2.5 V). The point is that the output 
voltage is ultra-stable and equal to 2.5 V over a large temperature range.
 The only problem is that 2.5 V may be too low a voltage reference for 
many applications. For instance, suppose we want a voltage reference of 10 V . 
Then, one solution is to use an MC1403 and a noninverting amplifi  er as shown in 
Fig. 18-7. With the circuit values shown, the voltage gain is:
Av 5   30 kV ______ 10 kV   1 1 5 4  
and the output voltage is:
Vout 5 4(2.5 V) 5 10 V
Because the closed-loop voltage gain of the noninverting amplifi  er is only 4, the 
output voltage will be a stable voltage reference of 10 V .
Application Example 18-1
One application for Fig. 18-6 is in a squelch circuit.  This kind of circuit is used in 
communication receivers to reduce listener fatigue by having a low voltage gain 
when no signal is being received. This way, the user does not have to listen to 
static when there is no communication signal. When a signal comes in, the voltage 
gain is switched to high.
 If R1 5 100 k V, Rf 5 100 k V, and R2 5 1 kV in Fig. 18-6, what is the 
voltage gain when the JFET is on? What is the voltage gain when the JFET is off? 
Explain how the circuit can be used as part of a squelch circuit.
SOLUTION  With the equations given in Fig. 18-6, the maximum voltage 
gain is:
Av 5   100 k V ____________   100 k V i 1 kV   1 1 5 102
The minimum voltage gain is:
Av 5   100 k V _______ 100 k V   1 1 5 2
When a communication signal is being received, we can use a peak detector and 
other circuits to produce a high gate voltage for the JFET in Fig. 18-6. This pro-
duces maximum voltage gain while the signal is being received. On the other 
hand, when no signal is being received, the output of the peak detector is low and 
the JFET is cut off, producing minimum voltage gain.748 Chapter 1818-3   Inverter/Noninverter Circuits
In this section, we will discuss circuit applications where the input signal drives 
both inputs of the op amp simultaneously. When an input signal drives both in-
puts, we get both inverting and noninverting amplifi  cation at the same time. This 
produces some interesting results because the output is the superposition of two 
amplifi  ed signals.
 The total voltage gain with an input signal driving both sides of the op 
amp equals the voltage gain of the inverting channel plus the voltage gain of the 
noninverting channel:
Av 5 Av(inv) 1 Av(non) (18-3)
We will use this equation to analyze the circuits of this section.
Switchable Inverter/Noninverter
Figure 18-8 shows an op amp that can function as either an inverter or a nonin-
verter. With the switch in the lower position, the noninverting input is grounded 
and the circuit is an inverting amplifi  er. Since the feedback and input resistances 
are equal, the inverting amplifi  er has a closed-loop voltage gain of:

the inverting channel is still:
Av(inv) 5 21
The voltage gain of the noninverting channel is:
Av(non) 5   R __ R   1 1 5 2
The total voltage gain is the superposition or algebraic sum of the two gains:
Av 5 Av(inv) 1 Av(non) 5 21 1 2 5 1
 The circuit is a switchable inverter/noninverter. It has a voltage gain of 
either 1 or 21, depending on the position of the switch. In other words, the circuit 
produces an output voltage with the same magnitude as the input voltage, but the 
phase can be switched between 0° and 2180°. As an example, if vin is 15 V , vout
will be either 15 V or 25 V depending on the switch position.
JFET-Controlled Switchable Inverter
Figure 18-9 is a modifi  cation of Fig. 18-8. The JFET acts like a voltage-controlled 
resistance rds. The JFET has either a very low or a very high resistance, depending 
on the gate voltage.
 When the gate voltage is low, it equals VGS(off) and the JFET is open. 
Therefore, the input signal drives both inputs. In this case:
Av(non) 5 2
Av(inv) 5 21
and
Av 5 Av(inv) 1 Av(non) 5 1
The circuit acts like a noninverting voltage amplifi  er with a closed-loop voltage 
gain of 1.
 When the gate voltage is high, it equals 0 V and the JFET has a very low 
resistance. Therefore, the noninverting input is approximately grounded. In this 
case, the circuit acts like an inverting voltage amplifi  er with a closed-loop voltage 
gain of 21. For proper operation, R should be at least 100 times greater than the 
rds of the JFET.
 In summary, the circuit has a voltage gain that can be either 1 or 21, 
 depending on whether the control voltage to the JFET is low or high.

When the variable resistor of Fig. 18-10 is zero, the noninverting input is grounded 
and the circuit becomes an inverting amplifi  er with a voltage gain of 2R2/R1. When 
the variable resistor is increased to R2, equal voltages drive the noninverting and in-
verting inputs of the op amp (common-mode input). Because of the common-mode 
rejection, the output voltage is approximately zero. Therefore, the circuit of 
Fig. 18-10 has a voltage gain that is continuously variable from 2R2/R1 to 0.+–

Application Example 18-2
When we need to vary the amplitude of an out-of-phase signal, we can use a 
 circuit like the one in Fig. 18-10. If R1 5 1.2 k V and R2 5 91 k V, what are the 
values of the maximum and minimum voltage gain?
SOLUTION  With the equation given in Fig. 18-10, the maximum voltage 
gain is:
Av 5   291 kV _______ 1.2 k V   5 275.8
The minimum voltage gain is zero.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 18-2   In Application Example 18-2, what value 
should R2 be changed to for a maximum gain of 250?
Sign Changer
The circuit of Fig. 18-11 is called a sign changer,  a rather unusual circuit because 
its voltage gain can be varied from 21 to 1. Here is the theory of operation: When 
the wiper is all the way to the right, the noninverting input is grounded and the 
circuit has a voltage gain of:
Av 5 21
 When the wiper is all the way to the left, the input signal drives the non-
inverting input as well as the inverting input. In this case, the total voltage gain is 
the superposition of the inverting and noninverting voltage gains:
Av(non) 5 2
Av(inv) 5 21
Av 5 Av(inv) 1 Av(non) 5 1Linear Op-Amp Circuit Applications 751 In summary, when the wiper is moved from right to left, the voltage gain 
changes continuously from 21 to 1. At the crossover point (wiper at center), a 
common-mode signal drives the op amp and the output is ideally zero.
Adjustable and Reversible Gain
Figure 18-12 shows another unusual circuit. It allows us to adjust the voltage gain 
between 2n and n. The theory of operation is similar to that of the sign changer. 
When the wiper is all the way to the right, the noninverting input is grounded and 
the circuit becomes an inverting amplifi  er with a closed-loop voltage gain of:
Av 5   2nR _____ R   5 2n
When the wiper is all the way to the left, it can be shown that:
Av(inv) 5 2n
Av(non) 5 2n
   A v 5 Av(non) 1 Av(inv) 5 n
These results can be derived by applying Thevenin’s theorem to the circuit and 
simplifying with algebra.
 Circuits like those in Figs. 18-11 and 18-12 are unusual because they 
have no simple discrete counterparts. They are good examples of circuits that 
would be diffi  cult to implement with discrete components but are easy to build 
with op amps.+–

If R 5 1.5 k V and nR 5 7.5 k V in Fig. 18-12, what is the maximum positive 
voltage gain? What is the value of the other fi  xed resistance?
SOLUTION  The value of n is:
n 5   7.5 k V — 1.5 k V   5 5
The maximum positive voltage gain is 5. The other fi  xed resistor has a value of:
  nR — n2 1   5   5(1.5 k V) _________  5 2 1   5 1.875 k V
With a circuit like this, we have to use a precision resistor to get a nonstandard 
value like 1.875 k V.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 18-3   Using Fig. 18-12, if R 5 1 kV, what is the 
maximum positive voltage gain and value of the other fi  xed resistance?
Phase Shifter
Figure 18-13 shows a circuit that can ideally produce a phase shift of 0° to 2180°. 
The noninverting channel has an RC lag circuit, and the inverting channel has 
two equal resistors with a value of R9. Therefore, the voltage gain of the inverting 
channel is always unity. But the voltage gain of the noninverting channel depends 
on the cutoff frequency of the RC lag circuit.
 When the input frequency is much lower than the cutoff frequency ( f , , fc), 
the capacitor appears open and:
Av(non) 5 2
 Av(inv) 5 21

This means that the output signal has the same magnitude as the input signal, and 
the phase shift is 0°, well below the cutoff frequency of the lag network.
 When the input frequency is much greater than the cutoff frequency 
(f . . fc), the capacitor appears shorted. In this case, the noninverting channel has 
a voltage gain of zero. The overall gain therefore equals the gain of inverting chan-
nel, which is 21, equivalent to a phase shift of  2180°.
 To calculate the phase shift between the two extremes, we need to cal-
culate the cutoff frequency using the equation given in Fig. 18-13. For instance, 
if C 5 0.022 /H9262F and variable resistor of Fig. 18-13 is set to 1 k V, the cutoff 
frequency is:
fc 5   1 _________________   2/H9266(1 kV)(0.022 /H9262F)   5 7.23 kHz
With a source frequency of 1 kHz, the phase shift is:

If the variable resistor is increased to 10 k V, the cutoff frequency decreases to

72.3 Hz and the phase shift increases to:

 In summary, the phase shifter produces an output voltage with the same 
magnitude as the input voltage, but with a phase angle that can be varied continu-
ously between 0° and 2180°.
18-4   Diff  erential Ampliﬁ  ers
This section will discuss how to build a differential amplifi  er using an op amp. 
One of the most important characteristics of a differential amplifi  er is its CMRR 
because the typical input signal is a small differential voltage and a large com-
mon-mode voltage.
Basic Diff  erential Ampliﬁ  er
Figure 18-14 shows an op amp connected as a differential amplifi  er. The resistor 
R19 has the same nominal value as R1 but differs slightly in value because of tol-
erances. For instance, if the resistors are 1 k V 6 1 percent, R1 may be as high as 
1010 V and R19 may be as low as 990 V, and vice versa. Similarly, R2 and R29 are 
nominally equal but may differ slightly because of tolerances.
 In Fig. 18-14, the desired input voltage vin is called the differential input 
voltage  to distinguish it from the common-mode input voltage vin(CM). A circuit 754 Chapter 18like Fig. 18-14 amplifi  es the differential input voltage vin to get an output voltage 
of vout. Using the superposition theorem, it can be shown that:
vout 5 Avvin
where
Av 5   2R2 ____ R1   (18-4)
This voltage gain is called the differential voltage gain  to distinguish it from the 
common-mode voltage gain Av(CM). By using precision resistors, we can build a 
differential amplifi  er with a precise voltage gain.
 A differential amplifi  er is often used in applications in which the dif-
ferential input signal vin is a small dc voltage (millivolts) and the common-mode 
input signal is a large dc voltage (volts). As a result, the CMRR of the circuit be-
comes a critical param eter. For instance, if the differential input signal is 7.5 mV 
and the common-mode signal is 7.5 V , the differential input signal is 60 dB less 
than the common-mode input signal. Unless the circuit has a very high CMRR, 
the common-mode output signal will be objectionably large.
CMRR of the Op Amp
In Fig. 18-14, two factors determine the overall CMRR of the circuit. First, there is 
the CMRR of the op amp itself. For a 741C, the minimum CMRR is 70 dB at low 
frequencies. If the differential input signal is 60 dB less than the common-mode 
input signal, the differential output signal will be only 10 dB greater than the com-
mon-mode output signal. This means that the desired signal is only 3.16 times 
greater than the undesired signal. Therefore, a 741C would be useless in an appli-
cation such as this.
 The solution is to use a precision op amp like an OP-07A. It has a min-
imum CMRR of 110 dB. This will signifi  cantly improve the operation. If the 
 differential input signal is 60 dB less than the common-mode input signal, the dif-
ferential output signal will be 50 dB greater than the common-mode output signal. 
This would be fi  ne if the CMRR of the op amp were the only source of error.
CMRR of External Resistors
There is a second source of common-mode error: the tolerance of the resistors in 
Fig. 18-14. When the resistors are perfectly matched:
R1 5 R19
R2 5 R29GOOD TO KNOW
High-speed data flow is accom-
plished with USB 3.0 (Universal 
Serial Bus 3.0) by using com-
plementary signals on pairs of 
wires, called differential pairs.  
These signals feed differential 
amplifiers which reject common-
mode noise interference and 
produce the desired output.++–

across the op-amp input terminals.
 On the other hand, when the resistors have a tolerance of 61 percent, the 
common-mode input voltage of Fig. 18-14 will produce a common-mode output 
voltage because the mismatch in the resistances produces a differential input volt-
age to the op amp.
 As discussed in Sec. 18-3, the overall voltage gain when the same signal 
drives both sides of an op amp is given by:
Av(CM) 5 Av(inv) 1 Av(non) (18-5)
In Fig. 18-14, the inverting voltage gain is:
Av(inv) 5   2R2 ____ R1   (18-6)
and the noninverting voltage gain is:
Av(non) 5  (    R2 ___ R1   1 1 )   (   R29 ________ R19 1 R29   )   (18-7)
where the second factor is the decrease in the noninverting input signal caused by 
the voltage divider on the noninverting side.
 With Eqs. (18-5) through (18-7), we can derive these useful formulas:
Av(CM) 5 62   DR ___ R    for R1 5 R2  (18-8)
Av(CM) 5 64   DR ___ R    for R1  R2  (18-9)
or
62 }D
RR}  Av(CM)  64   DR ___ R    (18-10)
In these equations, DR/R is the tolerance of the resistors converted to the decimal 
equivalent.
 For instance, if the resistors have a tolerance of 61 percent, Eq. (18-8) 
gives:
Av(CM) 5 62(1%) 5 62(0.01) 5 60.02
Equation (18-9) gives:
Av(CM) 5 64(1%) 5 64(0.01) 5 60.04
Inequality (18-10) gives:
60.02 , Av(CM) , 60.04
This says that the common-mode voltage gain is between 60.02 and 60.04. 
When necessary, we can calculate the exact value of Av(CM) with Eqs. (18-5) 
through (18-7). 
Calculating CMRR
Here is an example of how to calculate the CMRR: In a circuit like the one in 
Fig. 18-14, resistors with a tolerance of 60.1 percent are commonly used. When 
R1 5 R2, Eq. (18-4) gives a differential voltage gain of:
Av 5 21
and Eq. (18-8) gives a common-mode voltage gain of:
Av(CM) 5 62(0.1%) 5 62(0.001) 5 60.002756 Chapter 18The CMRR has a magnitude of:
CMRR 5   | Av | _______ | Av(CM) |   5   1 _____ 0.002   5 500
which is equivalent to 54 dB. ( Note:  The vertical bars around Av and Av(CM) indi-
cate absolute values.)
Buff  ered Inputs
The source resistances driving the differential amplifi  er of Fig. 18-14 effectively 
become part of R1 and R19, which changes the voltage gain and may degrade the 
CMRR. This is a very serious disadvantage. The solution is to increase the input 
impedance of the circuit.
 Figure 18-15 shows one way to do it. The fi  rst stage (the preamp) consists 
of two voltage followers that buffer  (isolate) the inputs. This can increase the input 
impedance to well over 100 M V. The voltage gain of the fi  rst stage is unity for both 
the differential and the common-mode input signal. Therefore, the second stage 
(the differential amplifi  er) still has to provide all the CMRR for the circuit.
Wheatstone Bridge
As previously mentioned, the differential input signal is often a small dc voltage. 
The reason it is small is because it is usually the output of a Wheatstone bridge 
like that in Fig. 18-16 a. A Wheatstone bridge is balanced when the ratio of resist-
ances on the left side equals the ratio of resistances on the right side:

+_ +_Figure 18-15   Diff  erential input with buff  ered inputs.Linear Op-Amp Circuit Applications 757When this condition is satisfi  ed, the voltage across R2 equals the voltage across R4
and the output voltage of the bridge is zero.
 The Wheatstone bridge can detect small changes in one of the resistors. 
For instance, suppose we have a bridge with three resistors of 1 k V and a fourth 
resistor of 1010 V, as shown in Fig. 18-16 b. The voltage across R2 is:
v2 5   1 kV_____ 2 kV  (15 V) 5 7.5 V
and the voltage across R4 is approximately:
v4 5   1010 V _______ 2010 V  (15 V) 5 7.537 V
The output voltage of the bridge is approximately:
vout 5 v4 2 v2 5 7.537 V 2 7.5 V 5 37 mV
Transducers
Resistance R4 may be an input transducer,  a device that converts a nonelectri-
cal quantity into an electrical quantity. For instance, a photoresistor converts a 
change in light intensity into a change in resistance, and a thermistor  converts a 
change in temperature into a change in resistance. Other input transducers that are 
common in industrial systems applications include thermocouples  and resistance 
temperature detectors  (RTDs).
 There is also the output transducer,  a device that converts an electrical 
quantity into a nonelectrical quantity. For instance, an LED converts current into 
light, and a loudspeaker converts ac voltage into sound waves.
 A wide variety of transducers are commercially available for quantities 
such as temperature, sound, light, humidity, velocity, acceleration, force, radioac-
tivity, strain, and pressure, to mention a few. These transducers can be used with 
a Wheatstone bridge to measure nonelectrical quantities. Because the output of a 
Wheatstone bridge is a small dc voltage with a large common-mode voltage, we 
need to use dc amplifi  ers that have very high CMRRs.+ –+VCC

 That gives you the basic idea of how a differential amplifi  er is used with 
a Wheatstone bridge. A circuit like Fig. 18-17 is adequate for some applications, 
but can be improved, as will be discussed in the following section.
18-5   Instrumentation Ampliﬁ  ers
This section discusses the instrumentation amplifi  er, a differential amplifi  er 
 optimized for its dc performance. An instrumentation amplifi  er has a large volt-
age gain, a high CMRR, low input offsets, low temperature drift, and high input 
 impedance.
Basic Instrumentation Ampliﬁ  er
Figure 18-18 shows the classic design used for most instrumentation amplifi  ers. 
The output op amp is a differential amplifi  er with the voltage gain of unity. The 
resistors used in this output stage are usually matched to within 60.1 percent or 
better. This means that the CMRR of the output stage is at least 54 dB.
 Precision resistors are commercially available from less than 1 V to more 
than 10 M V, with tolerances of 60.01 to 61 percent. If we use matched resistors 
that are within 60.01 percent of each other, the CMRR of the output stage can 
be as high as 74 dB. Also, temperature drift of precision resistors can be as low 
as 1 ppm/°C.
 The fi  rst stage consists of two input op amps that act like a preamplifi  er. 
The design of the fi  rst stage is extremely clever. What makes it so ingenious is 
the action of point A, the junction between the two R1 resistors. Point A acts like a 
virtual ground for a differential input signal and like a fl  oating point for the com-
mon-mode signal. Because of this action, the differential signal is amplifi  ed but 
the common-mode signal is not.
Point A
The key to understanding how the fi  rst stage works is to understand what point 
A does. With the superposition theorem, we can calculate the effect of each input 
with the other zeroed. For instance, assume that the differential input signal is 
zero. Then only the common-mode signal is active. Since the common-mode sig-
nal applies the same positive voltage to each noninverting input, equal voltages 
appear at the op-amp outputs. Because of this, the same voltage appears every-
where along the branch that contains R1 and R2. Therefore, point A is fl  oating and 760 Chapter 18each input op amp acts like a voltage follower. As a result, the fi  rst stage has a 
common-mode gain of:
Av(CM) 5 1
 Unlike the second stage, where the R resistors have to be closely matched 
to minimize the common-mode gain, in the fi  rst stage, the tolerance of the resis-
tors has no effect on the common-mode gain. This is because the entire branch 
containing these resistors is fl  oating at a voltage of vin(CM) above ground. So, the 
resistor values do not matter. This is another advantage of the three op-amp design 
of Fig. 18-18.
 The second step in applying the superposition theorem is to reduce the 
common-mode input to zero and to calculate the effect of the differential input 
signal. Since the differential input signal drives the noninverting inputs with equal 
and opposite input voltages, one op-amp output will be positive and the other will 
be negative. With equal and opposite voltages across the branch containing the R1 
and R2 resistors, point A will have a voltage of zero with respect to ground.
 In other words, point A is a virtual ground for the differential signal. For 
this reason, each input op amp is a noninverting amplifi  er and the fi  rst stage has a 
differential voltage gain of:
Av 5   R2 ___ R1   1 1  (18-14)
Since the second stage has a gain of unity, the differential voltage gain of the in-
strumentation amplifi  er is given by Eq. (18-14).
 Because the fi  rst stage has a common-mode gain of unity, the overall 
common-mode gain equals the common-mode gain of the second stage:

2+_Figure 18-18   Standard three op-amp instrumentation ampliﬁ  er.Linear Op-Amp Circuit Applications 761 To have high CMRR and low offsets, precision op amps must be used 
when building the instrumentation amplifi  er of Fig. 18-18. A typical op amp used 
in the three op-amp approach of Fig. 18-18 is the OP-07A. It has the following 
worst-case parameters: Input offset voltage is 0.025 mV , input bias current is 2 
nA, input offset current is 1 nA, AVOL is 110 dB, CMRR is 110 dB, and tempera-
ture drift is 0.6 /H9262V/°C.
 A fi  nal point about Fig. 18-18: Since point A is a virtual ground rather 
than a mechanical ground, the R1 resistors in the fi  rst stage do not have to be sep-
arate resistors. We can use a single resistor RG that equals 2 R1 without changing 
the operation of the fi  rst stage. The only difference is that the differential voltage 
gain is written as:
Av 5   2R2 ____ RG   1 1 (18-16)
The factor of 2 appears because RG 5 2R1.
Application Example 18-4 
In Fig. 18-18, R1 5 1 kV, R2 5 100 k V, and R 5 10 k V. What is the differential 
voltage gain of the instrumentation amplifi  er? What is the common-mode voltage 
gain if the resistor tolerances in the second stage are 60.01  percent? If vin 5 
10 mV and vin(CM) 5 10 V, what are the values of the differential and com-
mon-mode output signals?
SOLUTION  With the equations given in Fig. 18-18, the voltage gain of the 
preamp is:
Av 5   100 k V _______ 1 kV   1 1 5 101
Since the voltage gain of the second stage is 21, the voltage gain of the instru-
mentation amplifi  er is 2101.
 The common-mode voltage gain of the second stage is:
Av(CM) 5 62(0.01%) 5 62(0.0001) 5 60.0002
Since the fi  rst stage has a common-mode voltage gain of 1, the common-mode 
voltage gain of the instrumentation amplifi  er is 60.0002.
 A differential input signal of 10 mV will produce an output signal of:
vout 5 2101(10 mV) 5 21.01 V
A common-mode signal of 10 V will produce an output signal of:
vout(CM) 5 60.0002(10 V) 5 62 mV
Even though the common-mode input signal is 1000 times greater than the dif-
ferential input, the CMRR of the instrumentation amplifi  er produces a com-
mon-mode output signal that is approximately 500 times smaller than the differ-
ential output signal.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 18-4   Repeat Application Example 18-4 with 
R2 5 50 k V and 60.1 percent second-stage resistor tolerance.762 Chapter 18Guard Driving
Because the differential signal out of a bridge is small, a shielded cable is often 
used to isolate the signal-carrying wires from electromagnetic interference. But 
this creates a problem. Any leakage current between the inner wires and the shield 
will add to the low input bias and offset currents. Besides the leakage current, the 
shielded cable adds capacitance to the circuit, which slows down the response 
of the circuit to a change in transducer resistance. To minimize the effects of 
leakage current and cable capacitance, the shield should be bootstrapped to the 
common-mode potential. This technique is known as guard driving.
 Figure 18-19 a shows one way to bootstrap the shield to the com-
mon-mode voltage. A new branch containing the resistors labeled R3 is added 
to the output of the fi  rst stage. This voltage divider picks off the common-mode 
voltage and feeds it to a voltage follower. The guard voltage is fed back to the 
shield, as shown. Sometimes, separate cables are used for each input. In this case, 
the guard voltage is connected to both shields, as shown in Fig. 18-19 b.
Integrated Instrumentation Ampliﬁ  ers
The classic design of Fig. 18-18 can be integrated on a chip with all the compo-
nents shown in Fig. 18-18, except RG. This external resistance is used to control 
the voltage gain of the instrumentation amplifi  er. For instance, the AD620 is a 
monolithic instrumentation amplifi  er. The data sheet gives this equation for its 
voltage gain:
Av 5   49.4 k V _______  RG   1 1 (18-17)
 The quantity 49.4 k V is the sum of the two R2 resistors. The IC manu-
facturer uses laser trimming  to get a precise value of 49.4 k V. The word trim 
refers to a fi  ne adjustment rather than a coarse adjustment. Laser trimming means

application is in electrocardiog-
raphy (ECG) monitor circuits.Linear Op-Amp Circuit Applications 763burning off resistor areas on a semiconductor chip with a laser to get an extremely 
precise value of resistance.
 Figure 18-20 a shows the AD620 with an RG of 499 V. This is a precision 
resistor with a tolerance of 60.1 percent. The voltage gain is:
Av 5   49.4 k V —  499   1 1 5 100
The pinout  (pin numbers) of the AD620 is similar to that of a 741C since pins 2 
and 3 are for the input signals, pins 4 and 7 are for the supply voltages, and pin 6 
is the output. Pin 5 is shown grounded, the usual case for the AD620. But this pin 
does not have to be grounded. If necessary for interfacing with another circuit, we 
can offset the output signal by applying a dc voltage to pin 5.
 If guard driving is used, the circuit can be modifi  ed as shown in 
Fig. 18-20 b. The common-mode voltage drives a voltage follower whose output 
is connected to the shield of the cable. A similar modifi  cation is used if separate 
cables are used for the inputs.
 In summary, monolithic instrumentation amplifi  ers typically have a volt-
age gain between 1 and 1000 that can be set with one external resistor, a CMRR 
greater than 100 dB, an input impedance greater than 100 M V, an input offset 
voltage less than 0.1 mV , a drift of less than 0.5 /H9262V/°C, and other outstanding 
 parameters.
18-6   Summing Ampliﬁ  er Circuits
We discussed the basic summing amplifi  er in Chap. 16. Now, let us look at some 
variations of this circuit.
The Subtracter
Figure 18-21 shows a circuit that subtracts two input voltages to produce an out-
put voltage equal to the difference of v1 and v2. Here is how it works: Input v1
drives an inverter with a voltage gain of unity. The output of the fi  rst stage is 2v1. 
This voltage is one of the inputs to the second-stage summing circuit. The other 
input is v2. Since the gain of each channel is unity, the fi  nal output voltage equals 
v1 minus v2.(a)( b)

Sometimes you may see a circuit like Fig. 18-22. It is nothing more than a sum-
ming circuit that has inverting and noninverting inputs. The inverting side of the 
amplifi  er has two input channels, and the noninverting side has two input chan-
nels. The total gain is the superposition of the channel gains.
 The gain of each inverting channel is the ratio of the feedback resistor 
Rf to input channel resistance, either R1 or R2. The gain of each noninverting 
channel is:
  Rf ______ R1 i R2   1 1
reduced by the voltage-divider factor of the channel, either:
  R4 i R5 ___________  R3 1 R4 i R5  
or
  R3 i R5 ___________  R4 1 R3 i R5

channel gain, we can calculate total output voltage.

The Averager
Figure 18-23 is an averager,  a circuit whose output equals the average of the input 
voltages. Each channel has a voltage gain of:
Av 5   R — 3R   5   1 __ 3  
When all amplifi  ed outputs are added, we get an output that is the average of all 
input voltages.
 The circuit shown in Fig. 18-23 has three inputs. Any number of inputs 
can be used, as long as each channel input resistance is changed to nR, where n is 
the number of channels.
D/A Converter

sented value and converts it into a voltage or current. This voltage or current will

often used, the binary-weighted D/A converter and the R/2R ladder D/A  converter.
 The binary-weighted D/A converter is shown in Fig. 18-24. This circuit 
produces an output voltage equal to the weighted sum of the inputs. The weight  is 
the same as the gain of the channel. For instance, in Fig. 18-24 a the channel gains 
are:
Av3 5 21
Av2 5 20.5
Av1 5 20.25
Av0 5 20.125
The input voltages are digital or two-state, which means that they have a value of 
either 1 or 0. With 4 inputs, there are 16 possible input combinations of v3v2v1v0: 
0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101, 0110, 0111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 
1101, 1110, and 1111.
 When all inputs are zero (0000), the output is:
vout 5 0
When v3v2v1v0 is 0001, the output is:
vout 5 2(0.125) 5 20.125
When v3v2v1v0 is 0010, the output is:
vout 5 2(0.25) 5 20.25
and so on. When the inputs are all 1s (1111), the output is maximum and equals:
vout 5 2(1 1 0.5 1 0.25 1 0.125) 5 21.875
 If the D/A converter of Fig. 18-24 is driven by a circuit that produces 
the 0000 to 1111 sequence of numbers given earlier, it will produce these output 
 voltages: 0, 20.125, 20.25, 20.375, 20.5, 20.625, 20.75, 20.875, 21, 21.125, 
21.25, 21.375, 21.5, 21.625, 21.75, and 21.875. When viewed on an oscillo-
scope, the output voltage of the D/A converter will look like the negative-going 
staircase shown in Fig. 18-24 b.
 The staircase voltage demonstrates that the D/A converter does not pro-
duce a continuous range of output values. Therefore, strictly speaking, its output 
is not truly analog. Low-pass fi  lter circuits can be connected to the output to pro-
vide a smoother transition between output steps.vout

(a)( b)Figure 18-24   Binary-weighted D/A converter changes digital input to analog voltage.Linear Op-Amp Circuit Applications 767 A 4-input D/A converter has 16 possible outputs, an 8-input A/D con-
verter has 256 possible outputs, and a 16-input D/A converter has 65,536 possible 
outputs. This means that the negative-going staircase voltage of Fig. 18-24 b can 
have 256 steps with an 8-input converter and 65,536 steps with a 16-input con-
verter. A negative-going staircase voltage like this is used in a digital multimeter 
along with other circuits to measure the voltage numerically.
 The binary-weighted D/A converter can be used in applications where 
the number of inputs is limited and where high precision is not required. When 
a higher number of inputs is used, a higher number of different resistor values is 
required. The accuracy and stability of the D/A converter depends on the absolute 
accuracy of the resistors and their ability to track each other with temperature 
variations. Because the input resistors all have different values, identical tracking 
characteristics are diffi  cult to obtain. Loading problems can also exist with this 
type of D/A converter because each input has a different input impedance value.
 The R/2R ladder D/A converter,  shown in Fig. 18-25, overcomes the 
limitations of the binary-weighted D/A converter and is the method most often 
used in integrated-circuit D/A converters. Because only two resistor values are 
 required, this method lends itself to ICs with 8-bit or higher binary inputs and 
provides a higher degree of accuracy. For simplicity, Fig. 18-25 is shown as a 
4-bit D/A converter. The switches D0 – D3 would normally be some type of active 
switch. The switches connect the four inputs to either ground (logic 0) or 1Vref
(logic 1). The ladder network converts the possible binary input values from 0000 
through 1111 to one of 16 unique output voltage levels. In the D/A converter 
shown in Fig. 18-25, D0 is considered to be the least signifi  cant input bit (LSB), 
while D3 is the most signifi  cant bit (MSB).
 To determine the D/A converter’s output voltage, you must fi  rst change 
the binary input value to its decimal-equivalent value BIN. This can be done by:
BIN 5 (D0 3 20) 1 (D1 3 21) 1 (D2 3 22) 1 (D3 3 23) (18-18)
Then, the output voltage will be found by:
Vout 5 2 (   BIN ____ 
2N   3 2Vref )  (18-19)
where N equals the number of inputs.
 For more details on this circuit’s operation, the D/A converter can be 
Thevenized. This analysis can be found in Appendix D.

The short-circuit output current of an op amp is typically 25 mA or less. One way to 
get more output current is to use a power op amp like the LM675 or LM12. These 
op amps have short-circuit output currents of 3 and 10 A. Another way to get more 
short-circuit output current is to use a current booster,  a power transistor or other 
 device that has a current gain and a higher current rating than the op amp.
Unidirectional Booster
Figure 18-26 shows one way to increase the maximum load current. The output of 
an op amp drives an emitter follower. The closed-loop voltage gain is:

determine the decimal equivalent of the binary input (BIN) and the output voltage

has to supply base current to the emitter follower. Because of the current gain of 
the transistor, the maximum load current is increased to:
Imax 5 bdcISC (18-21)
where ISC is the short-circuit output current of the op amp. This means that an op 
amp like a 741C can have a maximum output current of 25 mA increased by a 
factor of /H9252dc. For instance, a BU806 is an npn power transistor with /H9252dc 5 100. If 
it is used with a 741C, the short-circuit output current increases to:
Imax 5 100(25 mA) 5 2.5 A
 The circuit can drive low-impedance loads because the negative feedback 
reduces the output impedance of the emitter follower by a factor of 1 1 AVOLB. 
Since the emitter follower already has a low output impedance, the closed-loop 
output impedance will be very small.
Bidirectional Current
The disadvantage of the current booster shown in Fig. 18-26 is its unidirectional 
load current.  Figure 18-27 shows one way to get a bidirectional load current.  An 
inverting amplifi  er drives a Class-B push-pull emitter follower. In this circuit, the 
closed-loop voltage gain is:
Av 5   2R2 ____ R1    (18-22)
When the input voltage is positive, the lower transistor is conducting and the load 
voltage is negative. When the input voltage is negative, the upper transistor is 
conducting and the output voltage is positive. In either case, the maximum output 
current is increased by the current gain of the conducting transistor. Since the 
Class-B push-pull emitter follower is inside the feedback loop, the closed-loop 
output impedance is very small.
Rail-to-Rail Op Amps
Current boosters are sometimes used in the fi  nal stage of an op amp. For instance, 
the MC33204 is a rail-to-rail op amp  that has a current-boosted output of 80 mA. 
Rail-to-rail  refers to the supply lines of an op amp because they look like rails on a 
schematic diagram. Rail-to-rail operation  means that the input and output voltages 
can swing all the way to the positive or negative supply voltages.770 Chapter 1818-8   Voltage-Controlled 
Current Sources
This section discusses circuits that allow an input voltage to control an output 
 current. The load may be fl  oating or grounded. All the circuits are variations of 
the VCIS prototype, which means that they are voltage-controlled current sources, 
also known as voltage-to-current converters.
Floating Load
Figure 18-28 shows the VCIS prototype. The load may be a resistor, a relay, or a 
motor. Because of the virtual short between the input terminals, the inverting input

In Fig. 18-27, R1 5 1 kV and R2 5 51 k V. If a 741C is used for the op amp, what 
is the voltage gain of the circuit? What is the closed-loop output impedance? 
What is the shorted-load current of the circuit if each transistor has a  current gain 
of 125?
SOLUTION  With the equations given in Fig. 18-26, the voltage gain is:
Av 5   251 kV _______  1 kV   5 251
The feedback fraction is:
B 5   1 kV ____________   1 kV 1 51 k V   5 0.0192
Since the 741C has a typical voltage gain of 100,000 and an open-loop output 
impedance of 75 V, the closed-loop output impedance is:
zout(CL) 5   75 V  ___________________   1 1 (100,000)(0.0192)   5 0.039 V
Since the 741C has a shorted-load current of 25 mA, the boosted value of the 
shorted-load current is:
Imax 5 125(25 mA) 5 3.13 A
PRACTICE PROBLEM 18-7   Using Fig. 18-27, change R2 to 27 k V. 
 Determine the new voltage gain, zout(CL) and Imax, when each transistor has a cur-
rent gain of 100. For instance, the 741C does not have a rail-to-rail output because the output 
is always 1 to 2 V less than either supply voltage. On the other hand, the MC33204 
does have a rail-to-rail output because its output voltage can swing to within 50 mV 
of either supply voltage, close enough to qualify as rail-to-rail. Rail-to-rail op amps 
allow a designer to make full use of the available supply voltage range.Linear Op-Amp Circuit Applications 771+

is bootstrapped to within microvolts of the noninverting input. Since voltage vin
appears across R, the load current is:
iout 5   vin ___ R    (18-23)
Since the load resistance does not appear in this equation, the current is independ-
ent of the load resistance. Stated another way, the load appears to be driven by a 
very stiff current source. As an example, if vin is 1 V and R is 1 k V, iout is 1 mA.
 If the load resistance is too large in Fig. 18-28, the op amp goes into sat-
uration and the circuit no longer acts like a stiff current source. If a rail-to-rail op 
amp is used, the output can swing all the way to 1VCC. Therefore, the maximum 
load voltage is:
VL(max) 5 VCC 2 vin  (18-24)
For example, if VCC is 15 V and vin is 1 V , VL(max) is 14 V . If the op amp does not 
have a rail-to-rail output, we can subtract 1 to 2 V from VL(max).
 Since the load current equals vin/R, we can derive this equation for the 
maximum load resistance that can be used without saturating the op amp:
RL(max) 5 R  (   VCC ____ vin   2 1 )   (18-25)
As an example, if R is 1 k V, VCC is 15 V , and vin is 1 V , then RL(max) 5 14 k V.
 Another limitation on a voltage-controlled current source is the short- 
circuit output current of the op amp. For instance, a 741C has a short-circuit 
 output current of 25 mA. As an equation, the short-circuit current out of the con-
trolled current source in Fig. 18-28 is:
Imax 5 ISC (18-26)
where ISC is the short-circuit output current of the op amp.
Application Example 18-8 
If the current source of Fig. 18-28 has R 5 10 k V, vin 5 1 V, and VCC 5 15 V, 
what is the output current? What is the maximum load resistance that can be used 
with this circuit if vin can be as large as 10 V?772 Chapter 18Grounded Load
If a fl oating load  is all right and the short-circuit current is adequate, a circuit like 
Fig. 18-28 works well. But if the load needs to be grounded or more short-circuit 
current is needed, we can modify the basic circuit as shown in Fig. 18-29. Since the 
collector and emitter currents of the transistor are almost equal, the current through 
R is approximately equal to the load current. Because of the virtual short between 
the op-amp inputs, the inverting input voltage approximately equals vin. Therefore, 
the voltage across R equals VCC minus vin and the current through R is given by:
iout 5   VCC 2 vin _________  R    (18-27)
 Figure 18-29 shows the equations for maximum load voltage, maximum 
load  resistance, and short-circuit output current. Notice that the circuit uses a cur-
rent booster on the output side. This increases the short-circuit output current to:
Imax 5 bdcISC  (18-28)

current booster increases the short-circuit output current by a factor  /H9252dc.
Howland Current Source
The current source of Fig. 18-30 produces a unidirectional load current. When 
a bidirectional current is needed, the Howland current source of Fig. 18-31 may 
be used. For a preliminary understanding of how it works, consider the special 
case of RL 5 0. When the load is shorted, the noninverting input is grounded, the 
 inverting input is at virtual ground, and the output voltage is:
vout 5 2vin
On the lower side of the circuit, the output voltage will appear across R in series 
with the shorted load. The current through R is:

means that the load voltage is inverted.
 When the load resistance is greater than zero, the analysis is much more 
complicated because the noninverting input is no longer grounded and the invert-
ing input is no longer a virtual ground. Instead, the noninverting input voltage 
equals the voltage across the load resistor. After writing and solving several equa-
tions, we can show that Eq. (18-30) is still valid for any load resistance, provided 
the op amp does not go into saturation. Since RL does not appear in the equation, 
the circuit acts like a stiff current source.
 Figure 18-31 shows the analysis equations. For instance, if VCC 5 15, 
vin 5 3 V , and R 5 1 kV, the maximum load resistance that can be used without

AGC  stands for automatic gain control.  In many electronic communications sys-
tems, like radio and  television, we want the voltage gain to change automatically 
when the input signal changes. Specifi  cally, when the input signal increases, we 
want the voltage gain to decrease. In this way, the output voltage of an amplifi  er will 
be approximately constant. One reason for wanting AGC in a radio or television is 
to keep the volume from changing abruptly when we tune in different stations.
Audio AGC
Figure 18-32 shows an audio AGC circuit. Q1 is a JFET used as a voltage- 
controlled resistance. For small-signal operation with drain voltages near zero, 
the JFET operates in the ohmic region and has a resistance of rds to ac signals. The 
rds of a JFET can be controlled by the gate voltage. The more negative the gate 
voltage is, the larger rds becomes. With a JFET like the 2N4861, rds can vary from 
100 V to more than 10 M V.
 R 3 and Q1 act like a voltage divider whose output varies between 0.001 vin
and vin. Therefore, the noninverting input voltage is between 0.001 vin and vin, a 
60-dB range. The output voltage of the noninverting amplifi  er is ( R2/R1 1 1) 
times this input voltage.
 In Fig. 18-32, the output voltage is coupled to the base of Q2. For a peak-to-
peak output less than 1.4 V , Q2 is cut off because there is no bias on it. With Q2 off, 
capacitor C2 is uncharged and the gate of Q1 is at 2VEE, enough negative voltage to 
cut off the JFET. This means that maximum input voltage reaches the noninverting 
input. In other words, an output voltage of less than 1.4 V p-p implies that the circuit 
acts like a noninverting voltage amplifi  er with a maximum input signal.
 When the output peak-to-peak voltage is greater than 1.4 V , Q2 conducts 
and charges capacitor C2. This increases the gate voltage and decreases rds. With a 
smaller rds, the output of the R3 and Q1 voltage divider decreases and there is less 
input voltage to the noninverting input. In other words, the overall voltage gain of 
the circuit decreases when the peak-to-peak output voltage is greater than 1.4 V .

output voltage increases only slightly for large increases in the input signal. One 
reason for using AGC is to reduce sudden increases in signal level and prevent 
overdriving a loudspeaker. If you are listening to a radio, you do not want an unex-
pected increase in the signal level to bombard your ears. In summary, even though 
the input voltage of Fig. 18-32 varies over a 60-dB range, the peak-to-peak output 
is only slightly more than 1.4 V .
Low-Level Video AGC
The signal out of a television camera has frequencies from 0 to well over 4 MHz. 
Frequencies in this range are called video frequencies.  Figure 18-33 shows a 
standard technique for video AGC that has been used for frequencies up to 10 
MHz. In this circuit, the JFET acts like a voltage-controlled resistance. When the 
AGC voltage is zero, the JFET is cut off by the negative bias and its rds is maxi-
mum. As the AGC voltage increases, the rds of the JFET decreases.
 The input voltage to the inverting amplifi  er comes from the voltage 
 divider formed by R5, R6, and rds. This voltage is given by:
vA 5   R6 1 Rds ____________   R5 1 R6 1 rds   vin
The voltage gain of the inverting amplifi  er is:

In this circuit, the JFET is a voltage-controlled resistance. The more positive 
the AGC voltage, the smaller the value of rds and the lower the input voltage to 
the inverting amplifi  er. This means that the AGC voltage controls the overall 
voltage gain of the circuit.
 With a wideband op amp, the circuit works well for input signals up to 
approximately 100 mV . Beyond this level, the JFET resistance becomes a func-
tion of the signal level in addition to the AGC voltage. This is undesirable because 
only the AGC voltage should control the overall voltage gain.
High-Level Video AGC
For high-level video signals, we can replace the JFET with an LED-photoresistor 
combination like Fig. 18-34. The resistance R7 of the photoresistor decreases as 
the amount of light increases. Therefore, the larger the AGC voltage, the lower the –

driving the inverting voltage amplifi  er. This voltage is given by:

The circuit can handle high-level input voltages up to 10 V because the photocell 
 resistance is unaffected by larger voltages and is a function only of VAGC. Also, there 
is almost total isolation between the AGC voltage and the input voltage vin.–

18-10   Single-Supply Operation
Using dual supplies is the typical way to power op amps. But this is not necessary 
or even desirable in some applications. This section discusses the inverting and 
noninverting amplifi  ers running off a single positive supply.778 Chapter 18Inverting Ampliﬁ  er
Figure 18-35 shows a single-supply inverting voltage amplifi  er that can be used with 
ac signals. The VEE supply (pin 4) is grounded, and a voltage divider applies half the 
VCC supply to the noninverting input. Because the two inputs are virtually shorted, 
the inverting input has a quiescent voltage of approximately 10.5VCC.
 In the dc-equivalent circuit, all capacitors are open and the circuit is a 
voltage follower that produces a dc output voltage of 10.5VCC. Input offsets are 
minimized because the voltage gain is unity.
 In the ac-equivalent circuit, all capacitors are shorted and the circuit is an 
inverting amplifi  er with a voltage gain of 2R2/R1. Figure 18-35 shows the analy-
sis equations. With these, we calculate the three lower cutoff frequencies.
 A bypass capacitor is used on the noninverting input, as shown in 
Fig.  18-35. This reduces the power-supply ripple and noise appearing at the 
noninverting input. To be effective, the cutoff frequency of this bypass circuit 
should be much lower than the ripple frequency out of the power supply. You 
can calculate the cutoff frequency of this bypass circuit with the equation given 
in Fig. 18-35.
Noninverting Ampliﬁ  er
In Fig. 18-36, only a positive supply is being used. To get maximum output swing, 
you need to bias the noninverting input at half the supply voltage, which is con-
veniently done with an equal-resistor voltage divider. This produces a dc input of 
10.5VCC at the noninverting input. Because of the negative feedback, the invert-
ing input is bootstrapped to the same value.
 In the dc-equivalent circuit, all capacitors are open and the circuit has a 
voltage gain of unity, which minimizes the output offset voltage. The dc output 
voltage of the op amp is 10.5VCC, but this is blocked from the fi  nal load by the 
output coupling capacitor.
 In the ac-equivalent circuit, all capacitors are shorted. When an ac signal 
drives the circuit, an amplifi  ed output signal appears across RL. If a rail-to-rail op 
amp is used, the maximum peak-to-peak unclipped output is VCC. Figure 18-36 
gives the equations for calculating the cutoff frequencies.
Single-Supply Op Amps
Although we can use ordinary op amps with a single supply, as shown in 
Figs. 18-35 and 18-36, there are some op amps that are optimized for single- supply –

for dual supplies. It contains four internally compensated op amps in a single 
package, each with an open-loop voltage gain of 100 dB, input biasing current of 
45 nA, input offset current of 5 nA, and input offset voltage of 2 mV . It runs off 
a single positive supply voltage that can have any value between 3 and 32 V . Be-
cause of this, the LM324 is convenient to use as an interface with digital circuits 
that run off a single positive supply of 15  V.+VCC

Summary
SEC. 18-1   INVERTING-
AMPLIFIER CIRCUITS
Inverting-ampliﬁ  er circuits discussed 
in this section included a high-
impedance probe (X10 and X1), an 
ac-coupled ampliﬁ  er, and an 
adjustable-bandwidth circuit.
SEC. 18-2   NONINVERTING-
AMPLIFIER CIRCUITS
Noninverting-ampliﬁ  er circuits dis-
cussed in this section included an 
ac-coupled ampliﬁ  er, an audio distri-
bution ampliﬁ  er, a JFET-switched am-
pliﬁ  er, and a voltage reference.
SEC. 18-3   INVERTER/
NONINVERTER 
CIRCUITS
The circuits discussed in this section 
are the switchable inverter/nonin-
verter, the JFET-controlled switchable inverter, the sign changer, the adjust-
able and reversible gain circuit, and 
the phase shifter.
SEC. 18-4   DIFFERENTIAL 
AMPLIFIERS
Two factors determine the overall 
CMRR of a diff  erential ampliﬁ  er: 
the CMRR of each op amp and the 
CMRR of the matched resistors. 
The input signal is usually a small 
diff erential voltage and a large 
common-mode voltage coming 
from a Wheatstone bridge.
SEC. 18-5   INSTRUMENTATION 
AMPLIFIERS
An instrumentation ampliﬁ  er is a dif-
ferential ampliﬁ  er optimized for large 
voltage gain, high CMRR, low input 
off sets, low-temperature drift, and 
high input impedance. Instrumenta-
tion ampliﬁ  ers can be built with the classic three op-amp circuit, using 
precision op amps, or with an inte-
grated instrumentation ampliﬁ  er.
SEC. 18-6   SUMMING 
AMPLIFIER CIRCUITS
The topics discussed in this section 
were the subtracter, summing on both 
inputs, the averager, and the D/A 
converter. The D/A converter is used 
in digital multimeters to measure volt-
ages, currents, and resistances.
SEC. 18-7   CURRENT BOOSTERS
When the short-circuit output current 
of an op amp is too low, one solution 
is to use a current booster on the 
output side of the circuit. Typically, 
the current booster is a transistor 
whose base current is supplied by 
the op amp. Because of the transistor 
current gain, the short-circuit output 
current is increased by the /H9252 factor.780 Chapter 18(18-3)   Gain for inverter/noninverter circuits:
 Av 5 Av(inv) 1 Av(non)
See Figs. 18-8 through 18-13. The total voltage gain is the 
superposition of the inverting and noninverting voltage 
gains. We use it when the input signal is being applied to 
both inputs.
(18-5)   Common-mode voltage gain:
 Av(CM) 5 Av(inv) 1 Av(non)
See Figs. 18-14, 18-15, and 18-18. This is similar to Eq. (18-3) 
because it is the superposition of gains.
(18-7)   Overall noninverter gain:
 Av(non) 5  (   R2 __ R1   1 1 )   (   R29 _______ R19 1 R29   ) 
See Fig. 18-14. This is the voltage gain of the noninverting 
side reduced by the voltage-divider factor.
(18-8)   Common-mode gain for R1 5 R2:
 Av(CM) 5 62   DR ___ R  
See Figs. 18-15 and 18-18. This is the common-mode gain 
caused by the resistor tolerances when the resistors of 
the diff  erential ampliﬁ  er are equal and matched.
(18-11)  Wheatstone bridge:
   R1 __ R2   5   R3 __ R4  
See Fig. 18-16 a. This is the equation for balance in a 
Wheatstone bridge.Derivations
(18-13)  Unbalanced Wheatstone bridge:
 vin >   DR ___ 4R   VCC
See Fig. 18-17. This equation is valid for small changes in 
the resistance of the transducer.
(18-16)  Instrumentation ampliﬁ  er:
 Av 5   2R2 ___ RG   1 1
See Figs. 18-18 and 18-20. This is the voltage gain of the ﬁ  rst 
stage of the classic three op-amp instrumentation ampliﬁ  er.
(18-18)  Binary-to-decimal equivalent:
 BIN 5 (Do 3 20) 1 (D1 3 21) 1 (D2 3 22) 1 (D3 3 23)
(18-19)  R/2R ladder output voltage:
 V out 52 (   BIN — 2N   3 2Vref ) 
(18-21)  Current booster:
 Imax 5 /H9252dcISC
See Figs. 18-26 through 18-30. The short-circuit current of 
an op amp is increased by the current gain of a transistor 
between the op amp and the load.
(18-23)  Voltage-controlled current sources:
 iout 5   vin __ R  
See Figs. 18-28 through 18-31. In voltage-controlled current 
sources, the input voltage is converted to a stiff   output current.

CURRENT SOURCES
We can build current sources that 
are controlled by an input volt-
age. The loads may be ﬂ  oating or 
grounded. The load currents may be 
unidirectional or bidirectional. The 
Howland current source is a bidi-
rectional voltage-controlled current 
source.SEC. 18-9   AUTOMATIC GAIN 
CONTROL
In many applications we want the 
voltage gain of a system to change 
automatically as needed to maintain 
an almost constant output voltage. 
In radio and television receivers, 
AGC prevents sudden and large 
changes in the volume of the sound 
out of the speakers.SEC. 18-10   SINGLE-SUPPLY 
OPERATION
Although op amps normally use dual 
supplies, there are applications for 
which only a single supply is preferred. 
When ac-coupled ampliﬁ  ers are 
needed, single-supply ampliﬁ  ers are 
easily implemented by biasing the 
nonsignal side of the op amp to half 
the positive supply voltage. Some op 
amps are optimized for single-supply 
operation.Linear Op-Amp Circuit Applications 781 4. In a controlled current source

Almost all communication systems use ﬁ  lters. A ﬁ  lter passes 
one band of frequencies while rejecting another. A ﬁ  lter can be 
either passive or active. Passive ﬁ  lters  are built with resistors, 
capacitors, and inductors. They are generally used above 1 MHz, 
have no power gain, and are relatively diffi   cult to tune. Active 
ﬁ lters  are built with resistors, capacitors, and op amps. They are 
useful below 1 MHz, have power gain, and are relatively easy 
to tune. Filters can separate desired signals from undesired 
signals, block interfering signals, enhance speech and video, 
and alter signals in other ways.

This chapter provides a comprehensive look at a variety of passive and active 
fi lter  circuits. Basic fi  lter terminology and fi  rst-order stages are covered through 
Sec.  19-4. Sections 19-5 and beyond contain more detailed circuit analysis of 
higher-order fi  lters.
The frequency response of a fi  lter  is the graph of its voltage gain versus 
frequency. There are fi  ve types of fi  lters: low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, band-
stop,  and all-pass . This section discusses the ideal frequency response of each. 
The next section describes the approximations for these ideal responses.
Low-Pass Filter
Figure 19-1 shows the ideal frequency response of a low-pass fi  lter.  It is some-
times called a brick wall response  because the right edge of the rectangle looks 
like a brick wall. A low-pass fi  lter passes all frequencies from zero to the cutoff 
frequency and blocks all frequencies above the cutoff frequency.
With a low-pass fi  lter, the frequencies between zero and the cutoff 
frequency are called the passband.  The frequencies above the cutoff frequency 
are called the stopband.  The roll-off region between the passband and the 
stopband is called the transition.  An ideal low-pass fi  lter has zero attenuation  
(signal loss) in the passband, infi  nite attenuation in the stopband, and a vertical 
transition.
One more point: The ideal low-pass fi  lter has zero phase shift for all 
frequencies in the passband. Zero phase shift is important when the input signal is 
nonsinusoidal. When a fi  lter has zero phase shift, the shape of the nonsinusoidal 
signal is preserved as it passes through the ideal fi  lter. For instance, if the input 
signal is a square wave, it has a fundamental frequency and harmonics. If the 
fundamental frequency and all signifi  cant harmonics (approximately the fi  rst 10) 
are inside the passband, the square wave will have approximately the same shape 
at the output.
High-Pass Filter
Figure 19-2 shows the ideal frequency response of a high-pass fi  lter.  A high-pass 
fi lter blocks all frequencies from zero up to the cutoff frequency and passes all 
 frequencies above the cutoff frequency.
With a high-pass fi  lter, the frequencies between zero and the cutoff 
 frequency are the stopband. The frequencies above the cutoff frequency are the 
passband. An ideal high-pass fi  lter has infi  nite attenuation in the stopband, zero 
 attenuation in the passband, and a vertical transition.

fcActive Filters 791Bandpass Filter
A bandpass fi  lter is useful in electronic communication systems, such as 
AM/FM receivers, where only a specifi  c range of frequencies should be passed 
and all others blocked. It is also useful in telephone communications equipment 
for separating the different phone conversations that are being simultaneously 
transmitted over the same communication path.
Figure 19-3 shows the ideal frequency response of a bandpass fi  lter. A 
brick wall response like this blocks all frequencies from zero up to the lower  cutoff 
frequency. Then, it passes all the frequencies between the lower and upper cutoff 
frequencies. Finally, it blocks all frequencies above the upper cutoff  frequency.
With a bandpass fi  lter, the passband is all the frequencies between the 
lower and upper cutoff frequencies. The frequencies below the lower cutoff fre-
quency and above the upper cutoff frequency are the stopband. An ideal bandpass 
fi lter has zero attenuation in the passband, infi  nite attenuation in the stopband, and 
two vertical transitions.
The bandwidth (BW)  of a bandpass fi  lter is the difference between its 
upper and lower 3-dB cutoff frequencies:
BW 5 f2 2 f1 (19-1)
For instance, if the cutoff frequencies are 450 and 460 kHz, the bandwidth is:
BW 5 460 kHz 2 450 kHz 5 10 kHz
As another example, if the cutoff frequencies are 300 and 3300 Hz, the bandwidth 
is:
BW 5 3300 Hz 2 300 Hz 5 3000 HzFigure 19-2   Ideal high-pass response.

f1 f2GOOD TO KNOW
Passive low-pass and high-pass 
filters can be combined to pro-
vide either bandpass or band-
stop filtering.792 Chapter 19The center frequency is symbolized by f0 and is given by the geometric 
average  of the two cutoff frequencies:
f0 5  Ï— f1 f2   (19-2)
For instance, telephone companies use a bandpass fi  lter with cutoff frequencies of 
300 and 3300 Hz to separate phone conversations. The center frequency of these 
fi  lters is:
f0 5  Ï——  (300 Hz)(3300 Hz)   5 995 Hz
To avoid interference between different phone conversations, the band-
pass  fi  lters have responses that approach the brick wall response shown in 
Fig. 19-3.
The Q of a bandpass fi  lter is defi  ned as the center frequency divided by 
the bandwidth:
Q 5   f0 ____ BW   (19-3)
For instance, if f0 5 200 kHz and BW 5 40 kHz, then Q 5 5.
When the Q is greater than 10, the center frequency can be approximated 
by the arithmetic average  of the cutoff frequencies:
f0 >   f1 1 f2 ______  2  
For instance, in an AM (amplitude modulated) radio receiver, the cutoff frequen-
cies of the bandpass fi  lter (IF stage) are 450 and 460 kHz. The center frequency 
is approximately:
f0 >   450 kHz 1 460 kHz  _________________  2   5 455 kHz
If Q is less than 1, the bandpass fi  lter is called a wideband fi  lter.  If Q is 
greater than 1, the fi  lter is called a narrowband fi  lter.  For example, a fi  lter with 
cutoff frequencies of 95 and 105 kHz has a bandwidth of 10 kHz. This is a nar-
rowband because Q is approximately 10. A fi  lter with cutoff frequencies of 300 
and 3300 Hz has a center frequency of approximately 1000 Hz and a bandwidth 
of 3000 Hz. This is wideband because Q is approximately 0.333.
Bandstop Filter
Figure 19-4 shows the ideal frequency response of a bandstop fi  lter.  This type of 
fi lter passes all frequencies from zero up to the lower cutoff frequency. Then, it 
blocks all the frequencies between the lower and upper cutoff frequencies.  Finally, 
it passes all frequencies above the upper cutoff frequency.

Av
f
f1 f2Active Filters 793With a bandstop fi  lter, the stopband is all the frequencies between the 
lower and upper cutoff frequencies. The frequencies below the lower cutoff fre-
quency and above the upper cutoff frequency are the passband. An ideal bandstop 
fi lter has infi  nite attenuation in the stopband, no attenuation in the passband, and 
two vertical transitions.
The defi  nitions for bandwidth, narrowband, and center frequency are the 
same as before. In other words, with a bandstop fi  lter, we use Eqs. (19-1) through 
(19-3) to calculate BW, f0, and Q. Incidentally, the bandstop fi  lter is sometimes 
called a notch fi  lter  because it notches out or removes all frequencies in the 
 stopband.
All-Pass Filter
Figure 19-5 shows the frequency response of an ideal all-pass fi  lter.  It has a pass-
band and no stopband. Because of this, it passes all frequencies between zero and 
infi nite frequency. It may seem rather unusual to call it a fi  lter since it has zero 
 attenuation for all frequencies. The reason it is called a fi  lter is because of the 
 effect it has on the phase  of signals passing through it. The all-pass fi  lter is useful 
when we want to produce a certain amount of phase shift for the signal being 
 fi ltered without changing its amplitude.
The phase response of a fi  lter  is defi  ned as the graph of phase shift  versus 
frequency. As mentioned earlier, the ideal low-pass fi  lter has a phase response of 
0° at all frequencies. Because of this, a nonsinusoidal input signal has the same 
shape after passing through an ideal low-pass fi  lter, provided its fundamental fre-
quency and all signifi  cant harmonics are in the passband.
The phase response of an all-pass fi  lter is different from that of the ideal 
low-pass fi  lter. With the all-pass fi  lter, each distinct frequency can be shifted by 
a certain amount as it passes through the fi  lter. For instance, the phase shifter dis-
cussed in Sec. 18-3 was a noninverting op-amp circuit with zero attenuation at all 
frequencies but an output phase angle between 0° and 2180°. The phase shifter 
is a simple example of an all-pass fi  lter. In later sections, we will discuss more 
complicated all-pass fi  lters that can produce larger phase shifts.
19-2  Approximate Responses
The ideal responses discussed in the preceding section are impossible to real-
ize with practical circuits, but there are fi  ve standard approximations used as 
 compromises for the ideal responses. Each of these approximations offers an Figure 19-5   Ideal all-pass response.

f794 Chapter 19 advantage that the others do not have. The approximation chosen by a designer 
will  depend on what is acceptable in an application.
Attenuation
Attenuation  refers to a loss of signal. With a constant input voltage, attenuation 
is defi  ned as the output voltage at any frequency divided by the output voltage in 
the midband:
Attenuation  5   vout __________ vout(mid)   (19-3a)
For instance, if the output voltage is 1 V at some frequency and the output voltage 
in the midband is 2 V , then:
Attenuation 5   1 V ____ 2 V   5 0.5
Attenuation is normally expressed in decibels using this equation:
Decibel attenuation  5 220 log attenuation  (19-3b)
For an attenuation of 0.5, the decibel attenuation is:
Decibel attenuation 5 220 log 0.5 5 6 dB
Because of the minus sign, decibel attenuation is always a positive number. Deci-
bel attenuation uses the midband output voltage as a reference. Basically, we are 
comparing the output voltage at any frequency to the output voltage in the mid-
band of the fi  lter. Because attenuation is almost always expressed in decibels, we 
will use the term attenuation  to mean decibel attenuation.
For instance, an attenuation of 3 dB means that the output voltage is 
0.707 of its midband value. An attenuation of 6 dB means that the output voltage 
is 0.5 of its midband value. An attenuation of 12 dB means that the output volt-
age is 0.25 of its midband value. An attenuation of 20 dB means that the output 
voltage is 0.1 of its midband value.
Passband and Stopband Attenuation
In fi  lter analysis and design, the low-pass fi  lter is a prototype,  a basic circuit that 
can be modifi  ed to get other circuits. Typically, any fi  lter problem is converted 
into an equivalent low-pass fi  lter problem and solved as a low-pass fi  lter problem; 
the solution is converted back to the original fi  lter type. For this reason, our dis-
cussion will focus on the low-pass fi  lter and extend the discussion to other fi  lters.
Zero attenuation in the passband, infi  nite attenuation in the stopband, and 
a vertical transition are unrealistic. To build a practical low-pass fi  lter, the three 
 regions are approximated as shown in Fig. 19-6. The passband is the set of frequen-
cies between 0 and fc. The stopband is all the frequencies above fs. The transition 
region is between fc and fs.
As shown in Fig. 19-6, the passband no longer has zero attenuation. 
 Instead, we are allowing for an attenuation between 0 and Ap. For instance, in 
some applications, the passband can have Ap 5 0.5 dB. This means that we are 
compromising the ideal response by allowing up to 0.5 dB of signal loss any-
where in the passband.
Similarly, the stopband no longer has infi  nite attenuation. Instead, we 
are allowing the stopband attenuation to be anywhere from As to infi  nity. For 
instance, in some applications, As 5 60 dB may be adequate. This means that we 
are  accepting an attenuation of 60 dB or more anywhere in the stopband.Active Filters 795In Fig. 19-6, the transition region is no longer vertical. Instead, we are 
accepting a nonvertical roll-off. The roll-off rate will be determined by the values 
of fc, fs, Ap, and As. For instance, if fc 5 1 kHz, fs 5 2 kHz, Ap 5 0.5 dB, and As 5
60 dB, the required roll-off is approximately 60 dB per octave.
The fi  ve approximations we are about to discuss are trade-offs between 
the characteristics of the passband, stopband, and transition region. The approx-
imations may optimize the fl  atness of the passband, or the roll-off rate, or the 
phase shift.
A fi  nal point: The highest frequency in the passband of a low-pass fi  lter 
is called the cutoff frequency  (fc). This frequency is also referred to as the edge 
frequency  because it is on the edge of the passband. In some fi  lters, the attenua-
tion at the edge frequency is less than 3 dB. For this reason, we will use f3dB for 
the frequency when the attenuation is down 3 dB and fc for the edge frequency, 
which may have a different attenuation.
Order of Filter
The order of a passive fi  lter (symbolized by n) equals the number of inductors 
and capacitors in the fi  lter. If a passive fi  lter has two inductors and two capacitors, 
n5 4. If a passive fi  lter has fi  ve inductors and fi  ve capacitors, n 5 10. Therefore, 
the order tells us how complicated the fi  lter is. The higher the order, the more 
complicated the fi  lter.
The order of an active fi  lter depends on the number of RC circuits 
(called poles ) it contains. If an active fi  lter contains eight RC circuits, n 5 8. 
Counting the individual RC circuits in an active fi  lter is usually diffi  cult. There-
fore, we will use a simpler method to determine the order of an active fi  lter:
n /H11061 # capacitors  (19-4)
where the symbol # stands for “the number of.” For instance, if an active fi  lter 
contains 12 capacitors, it has an order of 12.
Bear in mind that Eq. (19-4) is a guideline. Since we are counting ca-
pacitors rather than RC circuits, exceptions may occur. Aside from the occasional 
 exception, Eq. (19-4) gives us a quick and easy way to determine the order or 
number of poles in an active fi  lter.
Butterworth Approximation
The Butterworth approximation  is sometimes called the maximally fl  at approx-
imation  because the passband attenuation is zero through most of the passband Figure 19-6   Realistic low-pass response.

fSTOPBAND796 Chapter 19and decreases gradually to Ap at the edge of the passband. Well above the edge 
 frequency, the response rolls off at a rate of approximately 20 n dB per decade, 
where n is the order of the fi  lter:
Roll-off  5 20n    dB/decade (19-4a)
An equivalent roll-off in terms of octaves is:
Roll-off  5 6n    dB/octave (19-4b)
For instance, a fi  rst-order Butterworth fi  lter rolls off at a rate of 20 dB decade, 
or 6 dB per octave; a fourth-order fi  lter rolls off at a rate of 80 dB per decade, or 
24 dB per octave; a ninth-order fi  lter rolls off at a rate of 180 dB per decade, 
or 54 dB per octave; and so on.
Figure 19-7 shows the response of a Butterworth low-pass fi  lter with the 
following specifi  cations: n 5 6, Ap 5 2.5 dB, and fc 5 1 kHz. These specifi  cations 
tell us that it is a sixth-order or 6-pole fi  lter with passband attenuation of 2.5 dB 
and an edge frequency of 1 kHz. The numbers along the frequency axis of 
Fig. 19-7 are abbreviated as follows: 2E3 5 2 3 103 5 2000. ( Note:  E stands for 
“exponent.”)
Notice how fl  at the response is in the passband. The major advantage of a 
Butterworth fi  lter is the fl  atness of the passband response. The major disadvantage 
is the relatively slow roll-off rate compared with the other approximations.
Chebyshev Approximation
In some applications, a fl  at passband response is not important. In this case, a 
Chebyshev approximation  may be preferred because it rolls off faster in the 
transition region than a Butterworth fi  lter. The price paid for this faster roll-off is 
that ripples appear in the passband of the frequency response.
Figure 19-8 a shows the response of a Chebyshev low-pass fi  lter with 
the following specifi  cations: n 5 6, Ap 5 2.5 dB, and fc 5 1 kHz. These are the 
same specifi  cations as those of the preceding Butterworth fi  lter. When we com-
pare Fig. 19-7 with Fig. 19-8 a, we can see that a Chebyshev fi  lter of the same 
order has a faster roll-off in the transition region. Because of this, the attenuation 
with a Chebyshev fi  lter is always greater than the attenuation of a Butterworth 
 fi lter of the same order.
The number of ripples in the passband of a Chebyshev low-pass fi  lter 
equals half of the fi  lter order:

an order of 15, it will have 7.5 ripples. Figure 19-8 b shows a magnifi  ed view of a 
Chebyshev response for an order of 20. It has 10 ripples in the passband.
In Fig. 19-8 b, the ripples have the same peak-to-peak value. This is why 
the Chebyshev approximation is sometimes called the equal-ripple approxi mation.
Typically, a designer will choose a ripple depth between 0.1 and 3 dB,  depending 
on the needs of the application.
Inverse Chebyshev Approximation
In applications in which a fl  at passband response is required, as well as a fast roll-
off, a designer may use the inverse Chebyshev approximation.  It has a fl  at pass-
band response and a rippled stopband response. The roll-off rate in the transition 
region is comparable to the roll-off rate of a Chebyshev fi  lter.
Figure 19-9 shows the response of an inverse Chebyshev low-pass 
 fi lter  with the following specifi  cations: n 5 6, Ap 5 2.5 dB, and fc 5 1 kHz. 
When we compare Fig. 19-9 with Figs. 19-7 and 19-8 a, we can see that the 
 inverse Chebyshev fi  lter has a fl  at passband, a fast roll-off, and a rippled 
 stopband.
Monotonic  means that the stopband has no ripples. With the approxi-
mations discussed so far, the Butterworth and Chebyshev fi  lters have monotonic 
stopbands. The inverse Chebyshev has a rippled stopband.Figure 19-8   (a) Chebyshev low-pass response; ( b) magniﬁ  ed view of passband

1E5798 Chapter 19When specifying an inverse Chebyshev fi  lter, the minimum acceptable 
attenuation throughout the stopband must be given because the stopband has rip-
ples that may reach this value. For instance, in Fig. 19-9, the inverse Chebyshev 
fi lter has a stopband attenuation of 60 dB. As you can see, the ripples do approach 
this level at different frequencies in the stopband.
The unusual stopband response of Fig. 19-9 occurs because the inverse 
Chebyshev fi  lter has components that notch the response at certain frequencies in 
the stopband. In other words, there are frequencies in the stopband at which the 
 attenuation approaches infi  nity.
Elliptic Approximation
Some applications need the fastest possible roll-off in the transition region. 
If a rippled passband and a rippled stopband are acceptable, a designer may choose 
the elliptic approximation . Also known as the Cauer fi  lter,  this fi  lter  optimizes 
the transition region at the expense of the passband and stopband.
Figure 19-10 shows the response of an elliptic low-pass fi  lter with the 
same specifi  cations as before: n 5 6, Ap 5 2.5 dB, and fc 5 1 kHz. Notice that 
the elliptic fi  lter has a rippled passband, a very fast roll-off, and a rippled stop-
band. After the response breaks at the edge frequency, the initial roll-off is very 
rapid, slows down slightly in the middle of the transition, and then becomes very 
rapid toward the end of the transition. Given a set of specifi  cations for any com-
plicated fi  lter, the elliptic approximation will always produce the most effi  cient 
design; that is, it will have the lowest order.Figure 19-9   Inverse Chebyshev low-pass response.

Ap 5 0.5 dB, fc 5 1 kHz, As 5 60 dB, and fs 5 1.5 kHz. Here are the required 
orders or numbers of poles for each of the approximations: Butterworth (20), 
Chebyshev (9), inverse Chebyshev (9), and elliptic (6). In other words, the elliptic 
fi  lter requires the fewest capacitors, which translates to the simplest circuit.
Bessel Approximation
The Bessel approximation  has a fl  at passband and a monotonic stopband similar 
to those of the Butterworth approximation. For the same fi  lter order, however, 
the roll-off in the transition region is much less with a Bessel fi  lter than with a 
 Butterworth fi  lter.
Figure 19-11 a shows the response of a Bessel low-pass fi  lter with the 
same specifi  cations as before: n 5 6, Ap 5 2.5 dB, and fc 5 1 kHz. Notice that the 
Bessel fi  lter has a fl  at passband, a relatively slow roll-off, and a monotonic 
stopband. Given a set of specifi  cations for a complicated fi  lter, the Bessel 
 approximation will always produce the least roll-off of all the approximations. 
Stated  another way: It has the highest order or greatest circuit complexity of all 
 approximations.
Why is the order of a Bessel fi  lter the highest for the same specifi  cations? 
Because the Butterworth, Chebyshev, inverse Chebyshev, and elliptic approxi-
mations are optimized for frequency response only. With these approximations,

–540800 Chapter 19no attempt is made to control the phase of the output signal. On the other hand, 
the Bessel approximation is optimized to produce a linear phase shift  with fre-
quency. In other words, the Bessel fi  lter trades off some of the roll-off rate to get 
a linear phase shift.
Why bother with a linear phase shift? Recall the earlier discussion of 
the ideal low-pass fi  lter. One of its ideal properties was a phase shift of 0°. This 
was desirable because it meant that the shape of a nonsinusoidal signal would 
be preserved as it passed through the fi  lter. With a Bessel fi  lter, we cannot get a 
phase shift of 0°, but we can get a linear phase response. This is a phase response 
in which the phase shift increases linearly with frequency.
Figure 19-11 b shows the phase response of a Bessel fi  lter with n 5 6, 
Ap 5 2.5 dB, and fc 5 1 kHz. As you can see, the phase response is linear. The 
phase shift is approximately 14° at 100 Hz, 28° at 200 Hz, 42° at 300 Hz, and 
so on. This linearity exists through the entire passband and somewhat beyond. 
At  higher frequencies, the phase response becomes nonlinear, but that is not 
what matters. What counts is the linear phase response to all frequencies in the 
 passband.
The linear phase shift for all frequencies in the passband means that the 
fundamental frequency and harmonics of a nonsinusoidal input signal will shift 
linearly in phase as they pass through the fi  lter. Because of this, the shape of the 
output signal will be the same as the shape of the input signal.
The major advantage of the Bessel fi  lter is that it produces the least dis-
tortion of nonsinusoidal signals. One easy way to measure this type of distortion 
is by the step response of the fi  lter. This means applying a voltage step to the input 
and looking at the output with an oscilloscope. The Bessel fi  lter has the best step 
response of all the fi  lters.
Figures 19-12 a through c show the different step responses for a low-
pass  fi  lter with Ap 5 3 dB, fc 5 1 kHz, and n 5 10. Notice how the step response 
of a  Butterworth fi  lter (Fig. 19-12 a) overshoots the fi  nal level, rings a couple 
of times, and then settles on the fi  nal value of 1 V. A step response like this 
might be  acceptable in some applications, but it is not ideal. The step response 
of a  Chebyshev fi  lter (Fig. 19-12 b) is worse. It overshoots and rings many times 
 before settling on its fi  nal value. A step response like this is far from ideal and 
not acceptable in some applications. The step response of the inverse Chebyshev 
fi lter is similar to that of the Butterworth because both responses are maximally 
fl at in the passband. The step response of the elliptic fi  lter is similar to that of the 
Chebyshev because both responses have rippled passbands.
Figure 19-12 c shows the step response of a Bessel fi  lter. This is almost 
an ideal reproduction of an input voltage step. The only deviation from a  perfect 
step is the risetime. The Bessel step response has no noticeable overshoot 
or ringing. Since digital data consist of positive and negative steps, a clean 
step response like that shown in Fig. 19-12 c is preferred to the distortion of 
Figs. 19-12 a and b. For this reason, the Bessel fi  lter may be used in some data 
communication  systems.
A linear phase response implies a constant time delay,  which means that 
all frequencies in the passband are delayed by the same amount of time as they 
pass through the fi  lter. The amount of time it takes for a signal to pass through a 
fi lter depends on the order of the fi  lter. With all fi  lters except the Bessel fi  lter, this 
amount of time changes with the frequency. With the Bessel fi  lter, the time delay 
is constant at all frequencies in the passband.
As an illustration, Fig. 19-13 a shows the time delay for an elliptic  fi  lter 
with Ap 5 3 dB, fc 5 1 kHz, and n 5 10. Notice how the time delay changes with 
frequency. Figure 19-13 b shows the time delay of a Bessel fi  lter with the same 
specifi  cations. Notice how the time delay is constant through the passband and 
beyond. This is why the Bessel fi  lter is sometimes referred to as a  maximally fl  at 
delay fi  lter.  Constant time delay implies linear phase shift, and vice versa.Active Filters 801Roll-off   of Diff  erent Approximations

marized with simple equations because the roll-offs are nonlinear and depend on 
the fi  lter order, the ripple depth, and the other factors. Although we cannot write 
equations for these nonlinear roll-offs, we can compare the different roll-off rates 
in the transition region as follows.
Summary Table 19-1 shows the attenuation for n 5 6 and Ap 5 3 dB. 
The fi  lters have been ranked by their attenuations 1 octave above the edge fre-
quency. The Bessel fi  lter has the slowest roll-off, the Butterworth fi  lter is next, 
and so on. All fi  lters with rippled passbands or stopbands have transition roll-off 
rates that are faster than those of the Bessel and Butterworth fi  lters, which have 
no ripples in their frequency response.
Other Types of Filters
Most of the preceding discussion applies to the high-pass, bandpass, and band-
stop fi  lters. The approximations for a high-pass fi  lter are the same as those for 
a low-pass fi  lter, except that the responses are rotated horizontally around the 
edge frequency. For instance, Fig. 19-14 shows the Butterworth response for a 
high-pass fi  lter with n 5 6, Ap 5 2.5 dB, and fc 5 1 kHz. This is a mirror image 
of the low-pass response discussed earlier. The Chebyshev, inverse Chebyshev, 
elliptic, and Bessel high-pass responses are likewise mirror images of their low-
pass counterparts.Summary Table 19-1  Attenuation for Sixth-

Summary Table 19-2 summarizes the fi  ve approximations used in designing fi  l-
ters. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. When a fl  at passband is needed, 
the Butterworth and inverse Chebyshev fi  lters are the logical candidates. The re-
quired roll-off, order, and other design considerations will then determine which 
of the two will be used.
If a rippled passband is acceptable, the Chebyshev and elliptic fi  lters are 
the best candidates. Again, the required roll-off, order, and other design consider-
ations will then determine the fi  nal choice.
When the step response is important, the Bessel fi  lter is the logical can-
didate if it can meet the attenuation requirements. The Bessel approximation is 
the only one shown in the table that preserves the shape of a nonsinusoidal signal. 
This is critical in data communications because digital signals consist of positive 
and negative steps.
In applications in which a Bessel fi  lter cannot provide suffi  cient atten-
uation, we can cascade an all-pass fi  lter with a non-Bessel fi  lter. When prop-
erly  designed, the all-pass fi  lter can linearize the overall phase response to get an 
 almost perfect step response. A later section discusses this in more detail.
Op-amp circuits with resistors and capacitors can implement any of the 
fi ve approximations. As we will see, many different circuits are available that 
offer a trade-off between complexity of design, sensitivity of components, and 
ease of tuning. For instance, some second-order circuits use only one op amp and 
a few components. But these simple circuits have cutoff frequencies that are heav-
ily dependent on component tolerance and drift. Other second-order circuits may 
use three or more op amps, but these complex circuits are much less dependent on 
component tolerance and drift.
19-3  Passive Filters
Before discussing active-fi  lter circuits, there are two more ideas that we need 
to explore. A second-order low-pass LC fi lter has a resonant frequency and 
a Q—similar to a series or parallel resonant circuit. By keeping the resonant 
frequency constant but varying the Q, we can get ripples to appear in the passband 
of higher-order fi  lters. This section will describe the concept because it explains 
a great deal about the operation of active fi  lters.Summary Table 19-2 Filter Approximations

For instance, the fi  lter of Fig. 19-18 a has a resonant frequency and Q of:
f0 5   1  _____________________   2/H9266 Ï——  (9.55 mH)(2.65 /H9262F)     5 1 kHz
Q 5   600 V  ——   2/H9266(1 kHz)(9.55 mH)   5 10
Figure 19-18 b shows the frequency response. Notice how the response peaks 
at 1 kHz, the resonant frequency of the fi  lter. Notice also how the voltage gain 
 increases 20 dB at 1 kHz. The higher Q is, the greater the increase in voltage gain 
at the resonant frequency.
The fi  lter of Fig. 19-18 c has a resonant frequency and a Q of:
f0 5   1 ____________________   2/H9266 Ï——  (47.7 mH)(531 nF)     5 1 kHz
Q 5   600 V  __________________   2/H9266(1 kHz)(47.7 mH)   5 2
In Fig. 19-18 c, the inductance has been increased by a factor of 5 and the capaci-
tance has been decreased by a factor of 5 from the values of Fig. 19-18 a. Because 
the LC product is the same, the resonant frequency is still 1 kHz.
On the other hand, Q has decreased by a factor of 5 since it is inversely 
proportional to inductance. Figure 19-18 d shows the frequency response. Notice 
how the response again peaks at 1 kHz, but the increase in voltage gain is only 
6 dB, a result of the lower Q.
If we continue to decrease Q, the resonant peak will disappear. For 
 instance, the fi  lter of Fig. 19-18 e has:
f0 5   1 ___________________   2/H9266 Ï——  (135 mH)(187 nF)     5 1 kHz
Q 5   600 V  _________________   2/H9266(1 kHz)(135 mH)   5 0.707
Figure 19-18 f shows the frequency response, which is a Butterworth response. 
With Q of 0.707, the resonant peak disappears and the passband becomes max-
imally fl  at. Any second-order fi  lter with a Q of 0.707 always has a Butterworth 
 response.Figure 19-17   Second-order LC ﬁ  lter.

Figure 19-18 b has a low damping factor, only 0.1. In Fig. 19-18 d, the 
damping factor increases to 0.5 and the resonant peak decreases. In Fig. 19-18 f, 
the damping factor increases to 1.414 and the resonant peak disappears. As the 
word implies, damping  means “reducing” or “diminishing.” The higher the damp-
ing factor, the smaller the peak.
Butterworth and Chebyshev Responses
Figure 19-19 summarizes the effect of Q on a second-order fi  lter. As indicated 
in Fig. 19-19, a Q of 0.707 produces the Butterworth or maximally fl  at response. 
A Q of 2 produces a ripple depth of 6 dB, and a Q of 10 produces a ripple depth 
of 20 dB. In terms of damping, the Butterworth response is critically damped,  
whereas the rippled responses are underdamped.  A Bessel response (not shown) 
is overdamped  because its Q equals 0.577.
Higher-Order LC Filters
Higher-order fi  lters are usually built by cascading second-order stages. For example, 
Fig. 19-20 shows a Chebyshev fi  lter with an edge frequency of 1 kHz and a ripple 
depth of 1 dB. The fi  lter consists of three second-order stages, which means that the 
overall fi  lter has an order of 6. Since n 5 6, the fi  lter has three passband ripples.
Notice how each stage has its own resonant frequency and Q. The 
staggered resonant frequencies produce the three ripples in the passband. The 
staggered Qs maintain a ripple depth of 1 dB by producing peaks at frequen-
cies at which other stages have rolled off. For instance, the second stage has a 
resonant frequency of 747 Hz. At this frequency, the fi  rst stage has rolled off 
because its cutoff frequency is 353 Hz. The second stage compensates for the Figure 19-19   Eff ect of Q on second-order response.

the third stage has a cutoff frequency of 995 Hz. At this frequency, the fi  rst 
and second stages have rolled off, but the third stage compensates for their 
roll-offs by producing a high- Q peak at 995 Hz.
The idea of staggering the resonant frequencies and Qs of second-order 
stages applies to active fi  lters as well as to passive fi  lters. In other words, to build 
a high-order active fi  lter, we can cascade second-order stages whose resonant 
frequencies and Qs are staggered in precisely the right way to get the desired 
overall response.
19-4  First-Order Stages
First-order or 1-pole active-fi  lter stages have only one capacitor. Because of this, 
they can produce only a low-pass or a high-pass response. Bandpass and bandstop 
fi  lters can be implemented only when n is greater than 1.
Low-Pass Stage
Figure 19-21 a shows the simplest way to build a fi  rst-order low-pass active fi  lter. It 
is nothing more than an RC lag circuit and a voltage follower. The voltage gain is:

In Fig. 19-21 a, the op amp 
isolates the load from the RC 
low-pass filter at the input.810 Chapter 19The 3-dB cutoff frequency is given by:
fc 5   1 _______ 2pR1C1   (19-9)
When the frequency increases above the cutoff frequency, the capacitive reactance 
decreases and reduces the noninverting input voltage. Since the R1C1 lag circuit is 
outside the feedback loop, the output voltage rolls off. As the frequency approaches 
infi nity, the capacitor becomes a short and there is zero input voltage.
Figure 19-21 b shows another noninverting fi  rst-order low-pass fi  lter. 
 Although it has two additional resistors, it has the advantage of voltage gain. The 
voltage gain well below the cutoff frequency is given by:
Av 5   R2 ___ R1   1 1 (19-10)
The cutoff frequency is given by:
fc 5   1 — 2pR3C1   (19-11)
Above the cutoff frequency, the lag circuit reduces the noninverting input voltage. 
Since the R3C1 lag circuit is outside the feedback loop, the output voltage rolls off 
at a rate of 20 dB per decade.
Figure 19-21 c shows an inverting fi  rst-order low-pass fi  lter and its equa-
tions. At low frequencies, the capacitor appears to be open and the circuit acts like 
an inverting amplifi  er with a voltage gain of:
Av 5   2R2 ____ R1   (19-12)
As the frequency increases, the capacitive reactance decreases and reduces the im-
pedance of the feedback branch. This implies less voltage gain. As the frequency 
approaches infi  nity, the capacitor becomes a short and there is no voltage gain. As 
shown in Fig. 19-21 c, the cutoff frequency is given by:
fc 5   1 _______ 2pR2C1   (19-13)
There is no other way to implement a fi  rst-order low-pass fi  lter. In other 
words, the circuits shown in Fig. 19-21 are the only three confi  gurations available 
for an active-fi  lter low-pass stage.
A fi  nal point about all fi  rst-order stages. They can implement only a But-
terworth response. The reason is that a fi  rst-order stage has no resonant frequency. 
Therefore, it cannot produce the peaking that produces a rippled passband. This 
means that all fi  rst-order stages are maximally fl  at in the passband and monotonic 
in the stopband, and they roll off at a rate of 20 dB per decade.
High-Pass Stage
Figure 19-22 a shows the simplest way to build a fi  rst-order high-pass active fi  lter. 
The voltage gain is:
Av 5 1
The 3-dB cutoff frequency is given by:
fc 5   1 _______ 2pR1C1   (19-14)
 When the frequency decreases below the cutoff frequency, the capacitive reactance 
increases and reduces the noninverting input voltage. Since the R1C1 circuit is Active Filters 811 outside the feedback loop, the output voltage rolls off. As the frequency  approaches 
zero, the capacitor becomes an open and there is zero input voltage.
Figure 19-22 b shows another noninverting fi  rst-order high-pass fi  lter. 
The voltage gain well above the cutoff frequency is given by:
Av 5   R2 ___ R1   1 1 (19-15)
The 3-dB cutoff frequency is given by:
fc 5   1 _______ 2pR3C1   (19-16)
Well below the cutoff frequency, the RC circuit reduces the noninverting input 
voltage. Since the R3C1 lag circuit is outside the feedback loop, the output voltage 
rolls off at a rate of 20 dB per decade.
Figure 19-22 c shows another fi  rst-order high-pass fi  lter and its equa-

Order Low-Pass Filters
Second-order or 2-pole stages are the most common because they are easy to 
build and analyze. Higher-order fi  lters are usually made by cascading second-
order stages. Each second-order stage has a resonant frequency and a Q to 
determine how much peaking occurs.
This section discusses the Sallen-Key low-pass fi  lters  (named after the 
inventors). These fi  lters are also called VCVS fi  lters  because the op amp is used as 
a voltage-controlled voltage source. VCVS low-pass circuits can implement three 
of the basic approximations: Butterworth, Chebyshev, and Bessel.
Circuit Implementation
Figure 19-24 shows a Sallen-Key second-order low-pass fi  lter. Notice that the two 
resistors have the same value, but the two capacitors are different. There is a lag 
 circuit on the noninverting input, but this time, there is a feedback path through a 
second capacitor C2. At low frequencies, both capacitors appear to be open and the 
circuit has a unity gain because the op amp is connected as a voltage follower.

GOOD TO KNOW
The study of active filters can be 
a bit overwhelming. Take your 
time when working through the 
examples and doing the exper-
iments that correspond to the 
filters covered in this chapter.814 Chapter 19As the frequency increases, the impedance of C1 decreases and the nonin-
verting input voltage decreases. At the same time, capacitor C2 is feeding back a sig-
nal that is in phase with the input signal. Since the feedback signal adds to the source 
signal, the feedback is positive.  As a result, the decrease in the noninverting input 
voltage caused by C1 is not as large as it would be without the positive feedback.
The larger C2 is with respect to C1, the more the positive feedback; this 
is equivalent to increasing the Q of the circuit. If C2 is large enough to make Q 
greater than 0.707, peaking appears in the frequency response.
Pole Frequency
As shown in Fig. 19-24:
Q 5 0.5 Ï—
   C2 ___ C1     (19-19)
and
fp 5   1 __________  2pRÏ— C1C2     (19-20)
The pole frequency  (fp) is a special frequency used in the design of active fi  l-
ters. The mathematics behind the pole frequency are too complicated to go into 
here  because they involve an adv anced topic called the s plane.  Advanced courses 
analyze and design fi  lters using the s plane. ( Note: s  is a complex number given by 
/H9268 1 j/H9275.)
For our needs, it is enough to understand how to calculate the pole 
 frequency. In more complicated circuits, the pole frequency is given by:
fp 5   1 _____________   2/H9266 Ï— R1R2C1C2    
In a Sallen-Key unity-gain fi  lter, R1 5 R2 and the equation simplifi  es to Eq. (19-20).
Butterworth and Bessel Responses
When analyzing a circuit like the one shown in Fig. 19-24, we start by calculating 
Q and fp. If Q 5 0.707, we have a Butterworth response and a Kc value of 1. If Q 5 
0.577, we have a Bessel response and a Kc value of 0.786. Next, we can  calculate 
the cutoff frequency with:
fc 5 Kcfp (19-21)
With Butterworth and Bessel fi  lters, the cutoff frequency is always the frequency 
at which the attenuation is 3 dB.
Peaked Response
Figure 19-25 shows how to analyze the circuit when Q is greater than 0.707. After 
calculating the Q and the pole frequency of the circuit, we can calculate three 
other frequencies with these equations:
f0 5 K0fp (19-22)
fc 5 Kcfp (19-23)
f3dB 5 K3fp (19-24)
The fi  rst of these frequencies is the resonant frequency where peaking appears. 
The second is the edge frequency, and the third is the 3-dB frequency.
Summary Table 19-3 shows the K and Ap values versus Q. The Bessel and 
Butterworth values appear fi  rst. Because these responses have no noticeable reso-
nant frequency, the K0 and Ap values do not apply. When Q is greater than 0.707, a Active Filters 815noticeable resonant frequency appears and all K and Ap values are present. By 
plotting the values of Summary Table 19-3, we get Figs. 19-26 a and b. We can 
use the table for integral values of Q and the graphs for intermediate values of 
Q. For instance, if we calculate a Q of 5, we can read the following approximate 
 values from either Summary Table 19-3 or Fig. 19-26: K0 5 0.99, Kc 5 1.4, 
K3 5 1.54, and Ap 5 14 dB.Figure 19-25   Second-order VCVS stage for Q.0.707.

(b)GBW increases the Q of a stage. With high cutoff frequencies, a designer must be 
aware of limited GBW because it may change the performance of a fi  lter.
One way to correct for limited GBW is by means of predistortion.  This 
refers to decreasing the design value of Q as needed to compensate for limited 
GBW. For instance, if a stage should have a Q of 10 and a limited GBW increases 
it to 11, a designer can predistort by designing the stage with a Q of 9.1. The 
limited GBW will increase 9.1 to 10. Designers try to avoid predistortion because 
low-Q and high- Q stages sometimes interact adversely. The best approach is to 
use a better op amp, one with a higher GBW (same as funity).

The standard approach in building higher-order fi  lters is to cascade fi  rst- and 
 second-order stages. When the order is even, we need to cascade only second-or-
der stages. When the order is odd, we need to cascade second-order stages and 
a single fi  rst-order stage. For instance, if we want to build a sixth-order fi  lter, 
we can cascade three second-order stages. If we want to build a fi  fth-order fi  lter, 
we can cascade two second-order stages and one fi  rst-order stage.
Butterworth Filters
When fi  lter stages are cascaded, we can add the decibel attenuation of each stage 
to get the total attenuation. For instance, Fig. 19-30 a shows two cascaded sec-
ond-order stages. If each has a Q of 0.707 and a pole frequency of 1 kHz, then 
each stage has a Butterworth response with an attenuation of 3 dB at 1 kHz. Although 
each stage has a Butterworth response, the overall response is not a Butterworth 
 response because it droops at the pole frequency, as shown in Fig. 19-30 b. Since 
each stage has an attenuation of 3 dB at the cutoff frequency of 1 kHz, the overall 
attenuation is 6 dB at 1 kHz.
To get a Butterworth response, the pole frequencies are still 1 kHz, but 
the Qs of the stages have to be staggered above and below 0.707. Figure 19-30 c
shows how to get a Butterworth response for the overall fi  lter. The fi  rst stage has 
Q 5 0.54, and the second stage has Q 5 1.31. The peaking in the second stage off-
sets the droop in the fi  rst stage to get an attenuation of 3 dB at 1 kHz. Furthermore, 
it can be shown that the passband response is maximally fl  at with these Q values.
Summary Table 19-4 shows the staggered Q values of the stages 
used in higher-order Butterworth fi  lters. All the stages have the same pole fre-
quency, but each stage has a different Q. For instance, the fourth-order fi  lter de-
scribed by Fig. 19-30 c uses Q values of 0.54 and 1.31, the same values shown

14 nF and repeat Example 19.5.820 Chapter 19in  Summary Table 19-4. To build a tenth-order Butterworth fi  lter, we would 
need fi  ve stages with Q values of 0.51, 3.2, 0.56, 1.1, and 0.707.
Bessel Filters
With higher-order Bessel fi  lters, we need to stagger both the Qs and the pole 
frequencies of the stages. Summary Table 19-5 shows the Q and fp for each stage 
in a fi  lter with a cutoff frequency of 1000 Hz. For instance, a fourth-order Bessel 
fi lter needs a fi  rst stage with Q 5 0.52 and fp 5 1432 Hz, and a second stage with 
Q 5 0.81 and fp 5 1606 Hz.Summary Table 19-4  Staggered Qs for Butter-

Filter Design
The foregoing discussion gives you the basic idea behind the design of higher-
order fi  lters. So far, we have discussed only the simplest circuit implementation, 
which is the Sallen-Key unity-gain second-order stage. By cascading Sallen-Key 
unity-gain stages with staggered Qs and pole frequencies, we can implement 
higher-order fi  lters for the Butterworth, Bessel, and Chebyshev approximations.
The tables shown earlier indicate how the Qs and pole frequencies need 
to be staggered in different designs. Larger, comprehensive tables are available in 
fi lter handbooks. The design of active fi  lters is very complicated, especially when 
fi lters need to be designed with orders up to 20 and trade-offs are made between 
circuit complexity, component sensitivity, and ease of tuning.
Which brings us to an important point: All serious fi  lter design is done 
on computers because the calculations are too diffi  cult and time-consuming to  attempt 
by hand. An active-fi  lter computer program stores all the equations,  tables, and cir-
cuits needed to implement the fi  ve approximations discussed earlier  (Butterworth, 
Chebyshev, inverse Chebyshev, elliptic, and Bessel). The circuits used to build fi  lters 
range from a simple one op-amp stage to complex fi  ve op-amp stages.

Low-Pass Filters
Figure 19-31 shows another Sallen-Key second-order low-pass fi  lter. This time, both 
resistors and both capacitors have the same value. This is why the circuit is called a 
Sallen-Key equal-component fi  lter.  The circuit has a midband voltage gain of:
Av 5   R2 ___ R1   1 1 (19-29)
The operation of the circuit is similar to that of the Sallen-Key unity-gain fi  lter, 
 except for the effect of the voltage gain. Since the voltage gain can produce more

(a)positive feedback through the feedback capacitor, the Q of the stage becomes a 
function of voltage gain and is given by:
Q 5   1 ______ 3 2 Av   (19-30)
Because Av can be no smaller than unity, the minimum Q is 0.5. When 
Av increases from 1 to 3, Q varies from 0.5 to infi  nity. Therefore, the allowable 
range of Av is between 1 and 3. If we try to run the circuit with Av greater than 3, 
it will break into oscillations because the positive feedback is too large. In fact, 
it is dangerous to use a voltage gain that even approaches 3 because component 
tolerance and drift may cause the voltage gain to exceed 3. A later example will 
bring this point out more clearly.
After we calculate Av, Q, and fp with the equations shown in Fig. 19-31, 
the rest of the analysis is the same as before because a Butterworth fi  lter has 
Q 5 0.707 and Kc 5 1. A Bessel fi  lter has Q 5 0.577 and Kc 5 0.786. For other 
Qs, we can get the approximate K and Ap values by interpolating from Summary 
Table 19-3 or by using Fig. 19-26.824 Chapter 19

Av 5   30 kV ______ 51 kV   1 1 5 1.59

It takes a Q of 0.77 to produce a ripple of 0.1 dB. Therefore, a Q of 0.709 pro-
duces a ripple of less than 0.003 dB. For all practical purposes, the calculated Q of 
0.709 means that we have a Butterworth response to a very close approximation.
 The cutoff frequency of a Butterworth fi  lter is equal to the pole  frequency 
of 10.3 kHz. Notice in Fig. 19-32 b that the pole frequency is at approximately 
1 dB. This value is 3 dB down from the passband gain of 4 dB.

and the 3-dB frequency is:

The circuit produces a 26-dB peak in the response at 12.9 kHz, rolls off to 0 dB at 
the cutoff frequency, and is down 3 dB at 20 kHz.
 A Sallen-Key circuit like this is impractical because the Q is too high. 
Since the voltage gain is 2.95, any error in the values of R1 and R2 can cause large 
increases in Q. For instance, if the tolerance of the resistors is 61 percent, the 
voltage gain can be as high as:
Av 5   1.01(39 k V) ___________  0.99(20 k V)   1 1 5 2.989
This voltage gain produces a Q of:
Q 5   1 — 3 2 Av   5   1 _________  3 2 2.989   5 90.9
The Q has changed from a design value of 20 to an approximate value of 90.9, 
which means that the frequency response is radically different from the intended 
response.
 Even though the Sallen-Key equal-component fi  lter is simple compared 
to other fi  lters, it has the disadvantage of component sensitivity when high Qs are 
used. This is why more complicated circuits are typically used for high- Q stages. 
The added complexity reduces the component sensitivity.
19-8  VCVS High-Pass Filters
Figure 19-35 a shows the Sallen-Key unity-gain high-pass fi  lter and its equations. 
Notice that the positions of resistors and capacitors have been reversed. Also no-
tice that Q depends on the ratio of resistances rather than capacitances. The cal-
culations are similar to those discussed for low-pass fi  lters, except that we have 
to divide the pole frequency by the K value. To calculate the cutoff frequency of 
a high-pass fi  lter, we use:
fc 5   fp ___ Kc   (19-31)
Similarly, we divide the pole frequency by K0 or K3 for the other frequencies. For 
instance, if the pole frequency is 2.5 kHz and we read Kc 5 1.3 in Fig. 19-26, the 
cutoff frequency for the high-pass fi  lter is:

A bandpass fi  lter has a center frequency and a bandwidth. Recall the basic equa-
tions for a bandpass response:
BW 5 f2 2 f1
f0 5  Ï— f1 f2  
Q 5   f0 ____ BW  
When Q is less than 1, the fi  lter has a wideband response. In this case, a bandpass 
fi lter is usually built by cascading a low-pass stage with a high-pass stage. When 
Q is greater than 1, the fi  lter has a narrowband response and a different approach 
is used.
Wideband Filters
Suppose we want to build a bandpass fi  lter with a lower cutoff frequency of 300 Hz 
and an upper cutoff frequency of 3.3 kHz. The center frequency of the  fi  lter is:
f0 5  Ï— f1 f2   5  Ï——  (300 Hz)(3.3 kHz)   5 995 Hz
The bandwidth is:

The cutoff frequency is:

The 3-dB frequency is:
f3dB 5   fp ___ K3   5   5.31 kHz ________  1.48   5 3.59 kHz
The circuit produces a 6.3-dB peak in the response at 5.65 kHz, rolls off to 0 dB 
at the cutoff frequency of 4.02 kHz, and is down 3 dB at 3.59 kHz.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 19-10   Repeat Example 19-10 with the 15-k V
 resistor changed to 17.5 k V.830 Chapter 19Since Q is less than 1, we can use cascaded low-pass and high-pass 
stages, as shown in Fig. 19-38. The high-pass fi  lter has a cutoff frequency of 
300 Hz, and the low-pass fi  lter has a cutoff frequency of 3.3 kHz. When the two 
decibel responses are added, we get a bandpass response with cutoff frequencies 
of 300 Hz and 3.3 kHz.
When Q is greater than 1, the cutoff frequencies are much closer than 
shown in Fig. 19-38. Because of this, the sum of the passband attenuations is 
greater than 3 dB at the cutoff frequencies. This is why we use another approach 
for narrowband fi  lters.
Narrowband Filters
When Q is greater than 1, we can use the multiple-feedback (MFB)  fi  lter shown 
in Fig. 19-39. First, notice that the input signal goes to the inverting input rather 
than the noninverting input. Second, notice that the circuit has two feedback paths, 
one through a capacitor and another through a resistor.
At low frequencies, the capacitors appear to be open. Therefore, the input 
signal cannot reach the op amp, and the output is zero. At high frequencies, the capac-
itors appear to be shorted. In this case, the voltage gain is zero because the feedback 
capacitor has zero impedance. Between the low and high extremes in frequency, 
there is a band of frequencies where the circuit acts like an inverting amplifi  er.
The voltage gain at the center frequency is given by:
Av 5   2R2 ____ 2R1   (19-32)
This is almost identical to the voltage gain of an inverting amplifi  er, except for the 
factor of 2 in the denominator. The Q of the circuit is given by:

Increasing the Input Impedance
Equation (19-33) tells us that Q is proportional to the square root of R2/R1. 
To get high Qs, we need to use a high ratio of R2/R1. For instance, to get a Q of 5, 
R2/R1 must equal 100. To avoid problems with input offset and bias current, R2 is 
usually kept under 100 k V, which means that R1 has to be less than 1 k V. For Qs 
greater than 5, R1 must be even smaller. This means that the input impedance of 
Fig. 19-39 may be too low at higher Qs.
Figure 19-40 a shows an MFB bandpass fi  lter that increases the input 
impedance. The circuit is identical to the earlier MFB circuit, except for the new 
resistor R3. Notice that R1 and R3 form a voltage divider. By applying Thev-
enin’s theorem, the circuit simplifi  es to Fig. 19-40 b. This confi  guration is the

Tunable Center Frequency with Constant 
Bandwidth
Having a voltage gain greater than 1 is not necessary in many applications  because 
voltage gain is usually available in another stage. If unity voltage gain is accept-
able, then we can use a clever circuit that varies the center frequency while hold-
ing the bandwidth constant.

Equation (19-41) says that varying R3 will vary f0, but Eq. (19-42) shows 
that bandwidth is independent of R3. Therefore, we can have a constant bandwidth 
while varying the center frequency.
Variable resistor R3 in Fig. 19-41 is often a JFET used as a voltage- 
controlled resistance as discussed in earlier chapters. Since the gate voltage 
changes the  resistance of the JFET, the center frequency of the circuit can be 
tuned  electronically.

There are many circuit implementations for bandstop fi  lters. They use from one to 
four op amps in each second-order stage. In many applications, a bandstop fi  lter 
needs to block only a single frequency. For instance, the ac power lines may induce 
a hum of 60 Hz in sensitive circuits; this may interfere with a desired signal. In this 
case, we can use a bandstop fi  lter to notch out the unwanted hum signal.

Section 19-1 discussed the basic idea of the all-pass fi  lter.  Although the term 
all-pass fi  lter  is widely used in industry, a more descriptive name would be the 
phase fi  lter  because the fi  lter shifts the phase of the output signal without chang-
ing the magnitude. Another descriptive title would be the time-delay fi  lter,  since 
time delay is related to a phase shift.
First-Order All-Pass Stage
The all-pass fi  lter has a constant voltage gain for all frequencies. This type of fi  lter 
is useful when we want to produce a certain amount of phase shift for a signal 
without changing the amplitude.
Figure 19-45 a shows a fi  rst-order all-pass lag fi  lter.  It is fi  rst order be-
cause it has only one capacitor. Figure 19-45 a is a phase shifter circuit. It has the 
ability to shift the phase of the output signal between 0° and 2180°. The center 
frequency of an all-pass fi  lter is where the phase shift is half of maximum. For a 
fi  rst-order lag fi  lter, the center frequency has a phase shift of 290°.
Figure 19-45 b shows a fi  rst-order all-pass lead fi  lter.  In this case, the 
circuit shifts the phase of the output signal between 180° and 0°. This means that 
the output signal can lead the input signal by up to 1180°. For a fi  rst-order lead 
fi  lter, the phase shift is 190° at the center frequency.
Second-Order All-Pass Filter
A second-order all-pass fi  lter has at least one op amp, two capacitors, and 
several resistors that can shift the phase between 0° and 6360°. Furthermore, it is 
Figure 19-44 a shows the response. Notice how sharp the notch is for a second-order fi  lter.
 By increasing the order of the fi  lter, we can broaden the notch. For instance, Fig. 19-44 b shows the frequency 
 response for a notch fi  lter with n5 20. The broader notch reduces component sensitivity and guarantees that the 60-Hz hum 
will be heavily attenuated.

phase response between 0° and 6360°. The center frequency of a second-order

Figure 19-46 shows a second-order MFB all-pass lag fi  lter.  It has one op 
amp, four resistors, and two capacitors, which is the simplest confi  guration. More 
complex confi  gurations use two or more op amps, two capacitors, and several 
 resistors. With a second-order all-pass fi  lter, we can set the center frequency and 
Q of the circuit.
Figure 19-47 shows the phase response of a second-order all-pass lag 
fi lter with Q 5 0.707. Notice how the output phase increases from 0° to 2360°. 
By increasing the Q to 2, we can get the phase response shown in Fig. 19-47 b. 
The higher Q does not change the center frequency, but the phase change is faster 
near the center frequency. A Q of 10 produces the even steeper phase response of

To prevent distortion of digital signals (rectangular pulses), a fi  lter must have a lin-
ear phase shift for the fundamental and all signifi  cant harmonics. An equivalent 
requirement is a constant time delay for all frequencies in the passband. The Bessel 
approximation produces an almost linear phase shift and constant time delay. But 
in some applications, the slow roll-off rate of the Bessel approximation may not be 
adequate. Sometimes, the only solution is to use one of the other approximations to 
get the required roll-off rate and then use an all-pass fi  lter to correct the phase shift 
as needed to get an overall linear phase shift.Figure 19-47   Second-order phase responses: ( a) Q 5 0.707; ( b) Q 5 2; (c) Q 5 10.

For instance, suppose we need a low-pass fi  lter with Ap 5 3 dB, fc 5 1 kHz, 
As 5 60 dB, and fs 5 2 kHz and with a linear phase shift for all frequencies in the 
 passband. If a tenth-order Bessel fi  lter is used, it would produce the frequency re-
sponse of Fig. 19-48 a, the phase response of Fig. 19-48 b, the time-delay response 
of Fig. 19-48 c, and the step response of Fig. 19-48 d.
First off, notice how slow the roll-off is in Fig. 19-48 a. The cutoff fre-
quency is 1 kHz. An octave higher, the attenuation is only 12 dB, which does not 
meet the required specifi  cation of As 5 60 dB and fs 5 2 kHz. But look at how 
linear the phase response of Fig. 19-48 b is. This is the kind of phase response that 
is almost perfect for digital signals. Linear phase shift and constant time delay 
are synonymous. This is why the time delay is constant in Fig. 19-48 c. Finally, 
look at how sharp the step response of Fig. 19-48 d is. It may not be perfect, but 
it is close.
Butterworth Responses
To meet the specifi  cations, we can do the following: We can cascade a tenth-
order Butterworth fi  lter and an all-pass fi  lter. The Butterworth fi  lter will produce 
the required roll-off rate, and the all-pass fi  lter will produce a phase response that 
complements the Butterworth phase response to get a linear phase response.
A tenth-order Butterworth fi  lter will produce the frequency response 
of  Fig. 19-49 a, the phase response of Fig. 19-49 b, the time-delay response of Figure 19-48   Bessel responses for n 5 10: (a) Gain; ( b) phase; ( c) time delay; ( d) step response.

is 60 dB at 2 kHz (Fig. 19-49 a), which meets the specifi  cations of As 5 60 dB and 
fs 5 2 kHz. But look at how nonlinear the phase response of Fig. 19-49 b is. This 
kind of phase response will distort digital signals. Likewise, look at the peaked 
time delay of Fig. 19-49 c. Finally, look at the overshoot in the step response of 
Fig. 19-49 d.
Delay Equalizers
One of the main uses of all-pass fi  lters is to correct the overall phase response by 
adding the necessary phase shift at each frequency to linearize the overall phase 
response. When this is done, the time delay becomes constant and the overshoot 
disappears. When used to compensate for the time delay of another fi  lter, the all-
pass fi  lter is sometimes called a delay equalizer.  A delay equalizer has a time 
delay that looks like an inverted image of the original time delay. For instance, to 
compensate for the time delay of Fig. 19-49 c, the delay equalizer needs to have an 
upside-down version of Fig. 19-49 c. Since the total time delay is the sum of the 
two delays, the total time delay will be fl  at or constant.
The problem of designing a delay equalizer is extremely complicated. 
Because of the diffi  cult calculations that are required, only computers can fi  nd the 
component values in a reasonable amount of time. To synthesize an all-pass fi  lter, 
the computer has to cascade several second-order all-pass stages and then stagger 
the center frequencies and Qs as needed to get the fi  nal design.Figure 19-49   Butterworth responses for n510: (a) Gain; ( b) phase; ( c) time delay; ( d) step response.

Variable Filters
All second-order fi  lters discussed up to now have used only one op amp. These 
single op-amp stages are adequate for many applications. In the most stringent 
 applications, more complicated second-order stages are used.
Biquadratic Filter
Figure 19-50 shows a second-order biquadratic bandpass/lowpass fi  lter.  It has 
three op amps, two equal capacitors, and six resistors. Resistors R2 and R1 set the 
voltage gain. Resistors R3 and R39 have the same nominal value, as do R4 and R49. 
The circuit equations are shown in Fig. 19-50.
The biquadratic fi  lter is also referred to as a TT (Tow-Thomas) fi  l ter.
This type of fi  lter can be tuned by varying R3. This has no effect on the volt-
age gain, which is an advantage. The biquadratic fi  lter of Fig. 19-50 also has a 
low-pass output. In some applications, getting bandpass and low-pass responses 
 simultaneously is an advantage.
Here is another advantage of the biquadratic fi  lter: As shown in Fig. 19-50, 
the bandwidth of a biquadratic fi  lter is given by:
BW 5   1 ______ 2/H9266R2C  
With the biquadratic fi  lter of Fig. 19-50, we can independently vary the volt-
age gain with R1, the bandwidth with R2, and the center frequency with R3. Hav-
ing voltage gain, center frequency, and bandwidth all independently tunable is a 
major advantage and one of the reasons for the popularity of biquadratic fi  lters 
(also called biquads ).
By adding a fourth op amp and more components, we can also build bi-
quadratic high-pass, bandstop, and all-pass fi  lters. When component tolerance is 
a problem, biquadratic fi  lters are often used because they have less sensitivity to 
changes in the component values than do the Sallen-Key and MFB fi  lters.

In Fig. 19-45 b, R 5 1 kV and C 5 100 nF. What is the phase shift of the output

The phase shift is:

The state-variable fi  lter is also called a KHN fi  lter after the inventors (K erwin, 
Huelsman, and Newcomb). Two confi  gurations are available: inverting and 
 noninverting. Figure 19-51 shows a second-order state-variable fi  lter. It has three 
simultaneous outputs: low-pass, high-pass, and bandpass. This may be an advan-
tage in some applications.
By adding a fourth op amp and a few more components, the Q of the 
circuit becomes independent of the voltage gain and the center frequency. This 
means that the Q is constant when the center frequency is varied. A constant Q
means that bandwidth is a fi  xed percentage of the center frequency. For instance, 
if Q 5 10, bandwidth will be 10 percent of f0. This is desirable in some applica-
tions where the center frequency is varied.
Like the biquad, the state-variable fi  lter uses more parts than do the 
VCVS and MFB fi  lters. But the additional op amps and other components make 
it more suitable for higher-order fi  lters and critical applications. Furthermore, the 
biquad and state-variable fi  lters exhibit less component sensitivity, which results 
in a fi  lter that is easier to produce and requires less adjustment.
Conclusion
Summary Table 19-7 presents the four basic fi  lter circuits used to implement the 
different approximations. As indicated, the Sallen-Key fi  lters fall into the gen-
eral class of VCVS fi  lters, the multiple-feedback fi  lters are abbreviated MFB,  the 
 biquadratic fi  lters may be referred to as TT fi  lters,  and the state-variable fi  lters 
are known as KHN fi  lters.  The complexity of the VCVS and MFB fi  lters is low Figure 19-50   Biquadratic stage.

The VCVS and MFB fi  lters have a high sensitivity to component toler-
ance, whereas the TT and KHN fi  lters have a much lower component sensitivity. 
VCVS and MFB fi  lters may be somewhat diffi  cult to tune because of interac-
tion between voltage gain, cutoff and center frequencies, and Q. The TT fi  lter 
is easier to tune because its voltage gain, center frequency, and bandwidth are 
independently tunable. The KHN has independently tunable voltage gain, center 
frequency, and Q. Finally, the VCVS and MFB fi  lters offer simplicity, and the TT 
and KHN fi  lters offer stability and additional outputs. When the center frequency 
of a bandpass fi  lter is varied, the TT fi  lter has a constant bandwidth and the KHN 
fi  lter has a constant Q.

 circuits, the more complicated approximations (inverse Chebyshev and elliptic) 
cannot be implemented with VCVS or MFB circuits. Summary Table 19-8 shows 
the fi  ve approximations and the types of stages that can be used with them. As 
we can see, the rippled stopband responses of the inverse Chebyshev and the

we should be aware of the fact that many more circuits are available in computer 
programs that do fi  lter design. These include the following second-order stages: 
Akerberg-Mossberg, Bach, Berha-Herpy, Boctor, Dliyannis-Friend, Fliege, 
Mikhael-Bhattacharyya, Scultety, and the twin-T. All the active-fi  lter circuits

Summary
SEC. 19-1  IDEAL RESPONSES
There are ﬁ  ve basic types of re-
sponses: low-pass, high-pass, 
bandpass, bandstop, and all-pass. 
The ﬁ  rst four have a passband and 
a stopband. Ideally, the attenuation 
should be zero in the passband and 
inﬁ  nite in the stopband with a brick 
wall transition.
SEC. 19-2   APPROXIMATE 
RESPONSES
The passband is identiﬁ  ed by its low 
attenuation and its edge frequency. 
The stopband is identiﬁ  ed by its high 
attenuation and edge frequency. 
The order of a ﬁ  lter is the number 
of reactive components. With active ﬁ  lters, it is usually the number of 
capacitors. The ﬁ  ve approxi mations 
are the Butterworth (maximally ﬂ  at 
passband), the Chebyshev (rippled 
passband), the inverse Chebyshev 
(ﬂ  at passband and rippled stopband), 
the elliptic (rippled passband and 
stopband), and the Bessel (maximally 
ﬂ  at time delay).
SEC. 19-3   PASSIVE FILTERS
A low-pass LC ﬁ  lter has a resonant 
frequency f0 and a Q. The response 
is maximally ﬂ  at when Q 5 0.707. As 
Q increases, a peak appears in the 
response centered on the resonant 
frequency. The Chebyshev response 
occurs with Q greater than 0.707, 
and the Bessel with Q 5 0.577. The higher the Q, the faster the roll-off   in 
the transition region.
SEC. 19-4   FIRST-ORDER 
STAGES
First-order stages have a single ca-
pacitor and one or more resistors. 
All ﬁ  rst-order stages produce a But-
terworth response because peaking 
is possible only in second-order 
stages. A ﬁ  rst-order stage can pro-
duce either a low-pass or a high-pass 
response.
SEC. 19-5   VCVS UNITY-GAIN 
SECOND-ORDER 
LOW-PASS FILTERS
Second-order stages are the most 
common stage because they are 844 Chapter 19easy to implement and analyze. The 
Q of the stage produces diff  erent K 
values. The pole frequency of a low-
pass stage can be multiplied by its K 
values to get the resonant frequency 
if there is a peak, a cutoff   frequency, 
and a 3-dB frequency.
SEC. 19-6  HIGHER-ORDER 
FILTERS
Higher-order ﬁ  lters are usually made 
by cascading second-order stages 
or a ﬁ  rst-order stage when the total 
order is odd. When ﬁ  lter stages 
are cascaded, we add the decibel 
gains of the stages to get the total 
decibel gain. To get the Butterworth 
response for a higher-order ﬁ  lter, we 
have to stagger the Qs of the stages. 
To get the Chebyshev and other 
responses, we have to stagger the 
pole frequencies and the Qs.
SEC. 19-7  VCVS EQUAL-COM-
PONENT LOW-PASS 
FILTERS
The Sallen-Key equal-component 
ﬁ lters control the Q by setting the volt-
age gain. The voltage gain must be 
less than 3 to avoid oscillations. Higher 
Qs are diffi   cult to get with this circuit 
because the component tolerance becomes very important in determin-
ing the voltage gain and Q.
SEC. 19-8  VCVS HIGH-PASS 
FILTERS
VCVS high-pass ﬁ  lters have the 
same conﬁ  guration as low-pass 
ﬁ  lters, except that the resistors and 
capacitors are interchanged. Again, 
the Q values determine the K values. 
We have to divide pole frequency 
by the K values to get the resonant 
frequency, cutoff   frequency, and 3-dB 
frequency.
SEC. 19-9  MFB BANDPASS 
FILTERS
Low-pass and high-pass ﬁ  lters may 
be cascaded to get a bandpass 
ﬁ  lter, provided that Q is less than 1. 
When Q is greater than 1, we have a 
narrowband ﬁ  lter rather than a wide-
band ﬁ  lter.
SEC. 19-10  BANDSTOP FILTERS
Bandstop ﬁ  lters can be used to notch 
out a speciﬁ  c frequency, such as the 
60-Hz hum induced in circuits by ac 
power lines. With a Sallen-Key notch 
ﬁ  lter, the voltage gain controls the Q 
of the circuit. The voltage gain must 
be less than 2 to avoid oscillations.SEC. 19-11  THE ALL-PASS FILTER
Somewhat of a misnomer, the all-pass 
ﬁ  lter does more than pass all frequen-
cies with no attenuation. This type of 
ﬁ  lter is designed to control the phase 
of the output signal. Especially impor-
tant is the use of an all-pass ﬁ  lter as 
a phase or time-delay equalizer. With 
one of the other ﬁ  lters producing the 
desired frequency response and an 
all-pass ﬁ  lter producing the desired 
phase response, the overall ﬁ  lter has 
a linear phase response, equivalent to 
a maximally ﬂ  at time delay.
SEC. 19-12  BIQUADRATIC AND 
STATE-VARIABLE 
FILTERS
The biquadratic or TT ﬁ  lters use 
three or four op amps. Although 
more complex, the biquadratic ﬁ  lter 
off ers lower component sensitivity 
and easier tuning. This type of ﬁ  lter 
also has simultaneous low-pass and 
bandpass outputs, or high-pass and 
bandstop outputs. The state-variable 
or KHN ﬁ  lters also use three or more 
op amps. When a fourth op amp is 
used, it off  ers easy tuning because 
voltage gain, center frequency, and 
Q are all independently tunable.

Monolithic op amps are inexpensive, versatile, and reliable. They 
can be used not only for linear circuits like voltage ampliﬁ  ers, 
current sources, and active ﬁ  lters, but also for nonlinear circuits  
such as comparators, waveshapers, and active-diode circuits. 
The output of a nonlinear op-amp circuit usually has a diff  erent 
shape from the input signal because the op amp saturates 
during part of the input cycle. Because of this, we have to 
analyze two diff  erent modes of operation to see what happens 
during an entire cycle.

Often we want to compare one voltage with another to see which is larger. In this 
situation, a comparator  may be the perfect solution. A comparator is similar to 
an op amp because it has two input voltages (noninverting and inverting) and one 
output voltage. It differs from a linear op-amp circuit because it has a two-state 
output, either a low or a high voltage. Because of this, comparators are often used 
to interface with analog and digital circuits.
Basic Idea
The simplest way to build a comparator is to connect an op amp without feedback 
resistors, as shown in Fig. 20-1 a. Because of the high open-loop voltage gain, a 
positive input voltage produces positive saturation, and a negative input voltage 
produces negative saturation.
The comparator of Fig. 20-1 a is called a zero-crossing detector  because 
the output voltage ideally switches from low to high or vice versa whenever the 
input voltage crosses zero. Figure 20-1 b shows the input-output response of a 
zero-crossing detector. The minimum input voltage that produces saturation is:
vin(min)  5   6Vsat _____ AVOL  (20-1)
If Vsat 5 14 V , the output swing of the comparator is from approximately 214 
to 114 V . If the open-loop voltage gain is 100,000, the input voltage needed to 
produce saturation is:
vin(min)  5   614 V — 100,000   5 6 0.14 mV

The output of the comparator in 
Fig. 20-1 can be characterized as 
digital  in the sense that the output 
is always either high at 1Vsat or 
low at 2Vsat.Nonlinear Op-Amp Circuit Applications 853This means that an input voltage more positive than 10.140 mV drives the 
 comparator into positive saturation, and an input voltage more negative than 
20.140 mV drives it into negative saturation.
Input voltages used with comparators are usually much greater than
60.140 mV. This is why the output voltage is a two-state output, either 1Vsat or 
2Vsat. By looking at the output voltage, we can instantly tell whether the input 
voltage is greater than or less than zero.
Lissajous Pattern
A Lissajous pattern  appears on an oscilloscope when harmonically related 
 signals are applied to the horizontal and vertical inputs. One convenient way to dis-
play the input/output response of any circuit is with a Lissajous pattern in which 
the two harmonically related signals are the input and output voltages of the circuit.
For instance, Fig. 20-1 c shows the input/output response for a 741C with 
supplies of 615 V. Channel 1 (the vertical axis) has a sensitivity of 5 V/Div. As 
we can see, the output voltage is either 214 or 114 V, depending on whether the 
comparator is in negative or positive saturation.
Channel 2 (the horizontal axis) has a sensitivity of 10 mV/Div. In 
Fig. 20-1 c, the transition appears to be vertical. This means that the slightest 
positive input voltage produces positive saturation, and the slightest negative 
input produces negative saturation.
Inverting Comparator
Sometimes, we may prefer to use an inverting comparator like Fig. 20-2 a. The 
noninverting input is grounded. The input signal drives the inverting input of the 
vin

response.854 Chapter 20comparator. In this case, a slightly positive input voltage produces a maximum 
negative output, as shown in Fig. 20-2 b. On the other hand, a slightly negative 
input voltage produces a maximum positive output.
Diode Clamps
A previous chapter discussed the use of diode clamps  to protect sensitive circuits. 
Figure 20-2 a is a practical example. Here we see two diode clamps protecting the 
comparator against excessively large input voltages. For instance, the LM311 is 
an IC comparator with an absolute maximum input rating of 615 V . If the input 
voltage exceeds these limits, the LM311 will be destroyed.
With some comparators, the maximum input voltage rating may be as lit-
tle as 65 V, whereas with others it may be more than 630 V. In any case, we can 
protect a comparator against destructively large input voltages by using the diode 
clamps shown in Fig. 20-2 a. These diodes have no effect on the operation of the 
circuit as long as the magnitude of the input voltage is less than 0.7 V. When the 
 magnitude of the input voltage is greater than 0.7 V, one of the diodes will turn on 
and clamp the magnitude of the inverting input voltage to approximately 0.7 V.
Some ICs are optimized for use as comparators. These IC comparators 
often have diode clamps built into their input stages. When using one of these 
comparators, we have to add an external resistor in series with the input terminal. 
This series resistor will limit the internal diode currents to a safe level.
Converting Sine Waves to Square Waves
The trip point  (also called the threshold  or reference ) of a comparator is the input 
voltage that causes the output voltage to switch states (from low to high or from 
high to low). In the noninverting and inverting comparators discussed earlier, the 
trip point is zero because this is the value of input voltage where the output switches 
states. Since a zero-crossing detector has a two-state output,  any periodic input 
 signal that crosses zero threshold will produce a rectangular output waveform.
For instance, if a sine wave is the input to a noninverting comparator 
with a threshold of 0 V, the output will be the square wave shown in Fig. 20-3 a. 
As we can see, the output of a zero-crossing detector switches states each time the 
input voltage crosses the zero threshold.
Figure 20-3 b shows the input sine wave and the output square wave for 
an inverting comparator with a threshold of 0 V. With this zero-crossing detector, 
the output square wave is 180° out of phase with the input sine wave.
(a)( b)Figure 20-3  Comparator converts sine waves to square waves: ( a) Noninverting; ( b) inverting.Nonlinear Op-Amp Circuit Applications 855Linear Region
Figure 20-4 a shows a zero-crossing detector. If this comparator had an infi  nite 
open-loop gain, the transition between negative and positive saturation would be 
vertical. In Fig. 20-1 c, the transition appears to be vertical because the sensitivity 
of the 2 channel is 10 mV/Div.
When the sensitivity of the 2 channel is changed to 200 /H9262V/Div, we 
can see that the transition is not vertical, as shown in Fig. 20-4 b. It takes approxi-
mately 6100 /H9262V to get positive or negative saturation. This is typical for a com-
parator. The narrow input region between approximately 2100 and 1100 /H9262V is 
called the linear region of the comparator.  During a zero crossing, a changing 
input signal usually passes through the linear region so quickly that we see only a 
sudden jump between negative and positive saturation, or vice versa.
Interfacing Analog and Digital Circuits
Comparators usually interface at their outputs with digital circuits such as CMOS, 
EMOS, or TTL (stands for transistor-transistor logic,  a family of digital circuits).
Figure 20-5 a shows how a zero-crossing detector can interface with an 
EMOS circuit. Whenever the input voltage is greater than zero, the output of the 
comparator is high. This turns on the power FET and produces a large load current.
Figure 20-5 b shows a zero-crossing detector interfacing with a CMOS 
inverter. The idea is basically the same. A comparator input greater than zero 
produces a high input to the CMOS inverter.
Most EMOS devices can handle input voltages greater than 615 V, and 
most CMOS devices can handle input voltages up to 615 V. Therefore, we can 
interface the output of a typical comparator without any level shifting or clamp-
ing. TTL logic, on the other hand, operates with lower input voltages. Because (b)vin+VCC

discussed in the next section).
Clamping Diodes and Compensating Resistors
When a current-limiting resistor is used with clamping diodes, a compensating 
 resistor of equal size may be used on the other input of the comparator, as shown 
in Fig. 20-6. This is still a zero-crossing detector, except that it now has a compen-
sating resistor to eliminate the effect of input bias current.
As before, the diodes are normally off and have no effect on the operation 
of the circuit. It is only when the input tries to exceed 60.7 V that one of the clamp-
ing diodes turns on and protects the comparator against excessive input voltage.
Bounded Output
The output swing of a zero-crossing detector may be too large in some appli-
cations. If so, we can bound the output  by using back-to-back zener diodes, as vin

RBFigure 20-6   Using a compensating resistor to minimize the eff  ect of Iin(bias) .Nonlinear Op-Amp Circuit Applications 857shown in Fig. 20-7 a. In this circuit, the inverting comparator has a bounded out-
put because one of the diodes will be conducting in the forward direction and the 
other will be operating in the breakdown region.
For instance, a 1N4731A has a zener voltage of 4.3 V. Therefore, the 
voltage across the two diodes will be approximately 65 V. If the input voltage is a 
sine wave with a peak value of 25 mV, then the output voltage will be an inverted 
square wave with a peak voltage of 5 V.
Figure 20-7 b shows another example of a bounded output. This time, the 
output diode will clip off the negative half-cycles of the output voltage. Given an 
input sine wave with a peak of 25 mV, the output is bounded between 20.7 and 
115 V as shown.
A third approach to bounding the output is to connect zener diodes across 
the output. For instance, if we connect the back-to-back zener diodes of Fig. 20-7 a
across the output, the output will be bounded at 65 V.vin

SOLUTION   This circuit compares two voltages of opposite polarity to determine which is greater. If the magnitude of v1
is greater than the magnitude of v2, the noninverting input is positive, the comparator output is positive, and the green LED is 
on. On the other hand, if the magnitude of v1 is less than the magnitude of v2, the noninverting input is negative, the compar-
ator output is negative, and the red LED is on. If a 741C op amp is used, the LEDs at the output do not need current-limiting 
resistors because the maximum output current will be approximately 25 mA. D1 and D2 are input clamping diodes.
Application Example 20-2
What does the circuit of Fig. 20-9 do?
SOLUTION   To begin with, the output diode D1 clips off the negative half-cycles. Figure 20-9 also contains a signal 
called a strobe.  When the strobe is positive, Q1 saturates and pulls the output voltage down to approximately zero. When the 
strobe is zero, the transistor is cut off and the comparator output can swing positively. Therefore, the comparator  output can  
swing from 20.7 to 115 V when the strobe is low. When the strobe is high, the output is disabled. In this  circuit, the strobe 
is a signal used to turn the output off at certain times or under certain conditions.
Application Example 20-3
What does the circuit of Fig. 20-10 do?
SOLUTION   This is one way to create a 60-Hz clock,  a square-wave signal used as the basic timing mechanism for 
 inexpensive digital clocks. The transformer steps the line voltage down to 12 V ac. The diode clamps D1 and D2 then bound 
the input to 60.7 V . The inverting comparator produces an output square wave with a frequency of 60 Hz. The output signal 
is called a clock  because its frequency can be used to get seconds, minutes, and hours.
 A digital circuit called a frequency divider  can divide the 60 Hz by 60 to get a square wave with a period of 1 s. 
Another divide-by-60 circuit can divide this signal to get a square wave with a period of 1 min. A fi  nal divide-by-60 circuit 
produces a square wave with a period of 1 hr. Using the three square waves (1 s, 1 min, 1 hr) with other digital circuits and 
seven-segment LED indicators, we can display the time of day numerically.vin

In some applications, a threshold voltage different from zero may be preferred. By 
biasing either input, we can change the threshold voltage as needed.
Moving the Trip Point
In Fig. 20-11 a, a voltage divider produces the following reference voltage for the 
inverting input:
vref 5   R2 _______ R1 1 R2   VCC (20-2)
When vin is greater than vref, the differential input voltage is positive and the out-
put voltage is high. When vin is less than vref, the differential input voltage is neg-
ative and the output voltage is low.
A bypass capacitor is typically used on the inverting input, as shown in 
Fig. 20-11 a. This reduces the amount of power-supply ripple and other noise ap-
pearing at the inverting input. To be effective, the cutoff frequency of this bypass 
circuit should be much lower than the ripple frequency of the power supply. The 
cutoff frequency is given by:
fc 5   1 _____________   2p(R1 /H20648 R2)CBY   (20-3)
Figure 20-11 b shows the transfer characteristic  (input/output re-
sponse). The trip point is now equal to vref. When vin is greater than vref, the output 
of the comparator goes into positive saturation. When vin is less than vref, the out-
put goes into negative saturation.

itive output indicates that the input voltage exceeds a specifi  c limit. With different 
values of R1 and R2, we can set the limit anywhere between 0 and VCC. If a negative 
limit is preferred, connect 2VEE to the voltage divider, as shown in Fig. 20-11 c. Now 
a negative reference voltage is applied to the inverting input. When vin is more posi-
tive than vref, the differential input voltage is positive and the output is high, as shown 
in Fig. 20-11 d. When vin is more negative than vref, the output is low.
Single-Supply Comparator
A typical op amp like the 741C can run on a single positive supply by grounding the 
2VEE pin, as shown in Fig. 20-12 a. The output voltage has only one polarity, either 
a low or a high positive voltage. For instance, with VCC equal to 115 V , the output 
swing is from approximately 11.5 V (low state) to around 113.5 V (high state).
When vin is greater than vref, the output is high, as shown in Fig. 20-12 b. 
When vin is less than vref, the output is low. In either case, the output has a positive 
polarity. For many digital applications, this kind of positive output is preferred.
IC Comparators
An op amp like a 741C can be used as a comparator, but it has speed limitations 
because of its slew rate. With a 741C, the output can change no faster than 0.5 V/
/H9262s. Because of this, a 741C takes more than 50 /H9262s to switch output states with 
supplies of 615 V . One solution to the slew-rate problem is to use a faster op amp 
like an LM318. Since it has a slew rate of 70 V/ /H9262s, it can switch from 2Vsat to 
1Vsat in approximately 0.3 /H9262s.
Another solution is to eliminate the compensating capacitor found in a 
typical op amp. Since a comparator is always used as a nonlinear circuit, a com-
pensating capacitor is unnecessary. A manufacturer can delete the compensating 
capacitor and signifi  cantly increase the slew rate. When an IC has been optimized 
for use as a comparator, the device is listed in a separate section of the manufac-
turer’s data book. This is why you will fi  nd a section on op amps and another 
section on comparators in the typical data book.
Open-Collector Devices
Figure 20-13 a is a simplifi  ed schematic diagram for an open-collector compar-
ator.  Notice that it runs off a single positive supply. The input stage is a diff amp 
(Q1 and Q2). A current source Q6 supplies the tail current. The diff amp drives an 
active-load Q4. The output stage is a single transistor Q5 with an open collector. 
This open collector allows the user to control the output swing of the comparator.vin

–Figure 20-12   (a) Single-supply comparator; ( b) input/output response.Nonlinear Op-Amp Circuit Applications 861A typical op amp has an output stage that can be described as an 
active-pullup stage  because it contains two devices in a Class-B push-pull con-
nection. With the active pullup, the upper device turns on and pulls the output 
up to the high output state. On the other hand, an open-collector output stage of 
Fig. 20-13 a needs external components to be connected to it.
For the output stage to work properly, the user has to connect the open 
collector to an external resistor and supply voltage, as shown in Fig. 20-13 b. The 
resistor is called a pullup resistor  because it pulls the output voltage up to the 
supply voltage when Q5 is cut off. When Q5 is saturated, the output voltage is low. 
Since the output stage is a transistor switch, the comparator produces a two-state 
output.
With no compensating capacitor in the circuit, the output in Fig. 20-13 a
can slew very rapidly because only small stray capacitances remain in the circuit. 
The main limitation on the switching speed is the amount of capacitance across 
Q5. This output capacitance is the sum of the internal collector capacitance and 
the external stray wiring capacitance.
The output time constant is the product of the pullup resistance and the 
output capacitance. For this reason, the smaller the pullup resistance in Fig. 20-13 b, 
the faster the output voltage can change. Typically, R is from a couple of hundred 
to a couple of thousand ohms.
Examples of IC comparators are the LM311, LM339, and NE529. They 
all have an open-collector output stage, which means that you have to connect the 
output pin to a pullup resistor and a positive supply voltage. Because of their high 
slew rates, these IC comparators can switch output states in a microsecond or less.
The LM339 is a quad comparator —four comparators in a single IC 
package. It can run off a single supply or off dual supplies. Because it is inex-
pensive and easy to use, the LM339 is a popular comparator for general-purpose 
 applications.
Not all IC comparators have an open-collector output stage. Some, like 
the LM360, LM361, and LM760, have an active-collector output stage. The ac-
tive pullup produces faster switching. These high-speed IC comparators require 
dual supplies.Figure 20-13   (a) Simpliﬁ  ed schematic diagram of IC comparator; ( b) using pullup resistor with open-collector output stage.

The LM339 is an open-collector device. Figure 20-14 a shows how an LM339 can 
be connected to interface with TTL devices. A positive supply of 115 V is used 
for the comparator, but the open collector of the LM339 is connected to a supply 
of 15 V through a pullup resistor of 1 k V. Because of this, the output swings 
between 0 and 15 V , as shown in Fig. 20-14 b. This output signal is ideal for TTL 
devices because they are designed to work with supplies of 15 V.Figure 20-14   (a) LM339 comparator; ( b) input/output response.

In Fig. 20-15 a, the input voltage is a sine wave with a peak value of 10 V . What 
is the trip point of the circuit? What is the cutoff frequency of the bypass circuit? 
What does the output waveform look like?
SOLUTION   Since 115 V is applied to a 3:1 voltage divider, the reference 
 voltage is :
vref 5 1 5 V
This is the trip point of the comparator. When the sine wave crosses through this 
level, the output voltage switches states.
 With Eq. (20-3), the cutoff frequency of the bypass circuit is:

 5 0.239 Hz
This low cutoff frequency means that any 60-Hz ripple on the reference supply 
voltage will be heavily attenuated.
 Figure 20-15 b shows the input sine wave. It has a peak value of 10 V . 
The rectangular output has a peak value of approximately 15 V . Notice how the 
output voltage switches states when the input sine wave crosses the trip point 
of 15 V.Nonlinear Op-Amp Circuit Applications 863

 divided by the period and gave this equivalent defi  nition: Duty cycle equals the 
conduction angle divided by 360°.
 In Fig. 20-15 b, the sine wave has a peak value of 10 V . Therefore, the 
input voltage is given by:

The rectangular output switches states when the input voltage crosses 15 V . At 
this point, the foregoing equation becomes:

If the input to a comparator contains a large amount of noise, the output will be 
 erratic when vin is near the trip point. One way to reduce the effect of noise is by 
using a comparator with positive feedback. The positive feedback produces two 
separate trip points that prevent a noisy input from producing false transitions.
Noise
Noise  is any kind of unwanted signal that is not derived from or harmonically 
related to the input signal. Electric motors, neon signs, power lines, car ignitions, 
lightning, and so on produce electromagnetic fi  elds that can induce noise voltages 
into electronic circuits. Power-supply ripple is also classifi  ed as noise since it is 
not related to the input signal. By using regulated power supplies and shielding, 
we usually can reduce the ripple and induced noise to an acceptable level.
Thermal noise,  on the other hand, is caused by the random motion of 
free electrons inside a resistor (see Fig. 20-16 a). The energy for this electron mo-
tion comes from the thermal energy of the surrounding air. The higher the ambient 
temperature, the more active the electrons.
The motion of billions of free electrons inside a resistor is pure chaos. 
At some instants, more electrons move up than down, producing a small negative 
voltage across the resistor. At other instants, more electrons move down than up, 
producing a positive voltage. If this type of noise were amplifi  ed and viewed on 
an oscilloscope, it would resemble Fig. 20-16 b. Like any voltage, noise has an 
rms or effective value. As an approximation, the highest noise peaks are about 
four times the rms value.
The randomness of the electron motion inside a resistor produces a dis-
tribution of noise at virtually all frequencies. The rms value of this noise increases 
with temperature, bandwidth, and resistance. For our purposes, we need to be 
aware of how noise may affect the output of a comparator.

The duty cycle in Fig. 20-15 b can be expressed as 33.3 percent.Nonlinear Op-Amp Circuit Applications 865Noise Triggering
As discussed in Sec. 20-1, the high open-loop gain of a comparator means that 
an input of only 100 /H9262V may be enough to switch the output from one state to 
another. If the input contains noise with a peak of 100 /H9262V or more, the comparator 
will detect the zero crossings produced by the noise.
Figure 20-17 shows the output of a comparator with no input signal, ex-
cept for noise. When the noise peaks are large enough, they produce unwanted 
changes in the comparator output. For instance, the noise peaks at A, B, and C are 
producing unwanted transitions from low to high. When an input signal is present, 
the noise is superimposed on the input signal and produces erratic triggering.
Schmitt Trigger
The standard solution for a noisy input is to use a comparator like the one shown 
in Fig. 20-18 a. The input voltage is applied to the inverting input. Because the 
feedback voltage at the noninverting input is aiding the input voltage, the feed-
back is positive.  A comparator using positive feedback like this is usually called 
a Schmitt trigger.
When the comparator is positively saturated, a positive voltage is fed 
back to the noninverting input. This positive feedback voltage holds the output in 
the high state. Similarly, when the output voltage is negatively saturated, a nega tive Figure 20-17   Noise produces false triggering of comparator.

B 5  R1 _______ R1 1 R2   (20-4)
When the output is positively saturated, the reference voltage applied to the non-
inverting input is:
vref 5 1BV sat (20-5a)
When the output is negatively saturated, the reference voltage is:
vref 5 2BV sat (20-5b)
The output voltage will remain in a given state until the input voltage 
 exceeds the reference voltage for that state. For instance, if the output is positively 
saturated, the reference voltage is 1BVsat. The input voltage must be increased to 
slightly more than 1BVsat to switch the output voltage from positive to negative, 
as shown in Fig. 20-18 b. Once the output is in the negative state, it will remain 
there indefi  nitely until the input voltage becomes more negative than 2BVsat. 
Then, the output switches from negative to positive (Fig. 20-18 b).
Hysteresis
The unusual response of Fig. 20-18 b has a useful property called hysteresis.  To 
 understand this concept, put your fi  nger on the upper end of the graph where it 
says 1Vsat. Assume that this is the current value of output voltage. Move your 
fi nger to the right along the horizontal line. Along this horizontal line, the input 
voltage is changing but the output voltage is still equal to 1Vsat. When you reach 
the upper-right corner, vin equals 1BVsat. When vin increases to slightly more than 
1BVsat, the output voltage goes into the transition region between the high and 
the low states.
If you move your fi  nger down along the vertical line, you will simulate the 
transition of the output voltage from high to low. When your fi  nger is on the lower 
horizontal line, the output voltage is negatively saturated and equal to 2Vsat.
To switch back to the high output state, move your fi  nger until it reaches 
the lower-left corner. At this point, vin equals 2BVsat. When vin becomes slightly 
more negative than 2BVsat, the output voltage goes into the transition from low 
to high. If you move your fi  nger up along the vertical line, you will simulate the 
switching of the output voltage from low to high.
In Fig. 20-18 b, the trip points are defi  ned as the two input voltages where 
the output voltage changes states. The upper trip point (UTP)  has the value:
UTP  5 BV sat (20-6)
and the lower trip point (LTP)  has the value:
LTP 5 2BV sat (20-7)
The difference between these trip points is defi  ned as the hysteresis (also called 
the deadband ):
H 5 UTP  2 LTP (20-8)
With Eqs. (20-6) and (20-7), this becomes:
H 5 BVsat 2 (2BVsat)
which equals:
H 5 2BV sat (20-9)Nonlinear Op-Amp Circuit Applications 867Positive feedback causes the hysteresis of Fig. 20-18 b. If there were no 
positive feedback, B would equal zero and the hysteresis would disappear because 
both trip points would equal zero.
Hysteresis is desirable in a Schmitt trigger because it prevents noise 
from causing false triggering. If the peak-to-peak noise voltage is less than the 
hysteresis, the noise cannot produce false triggering. For instance, if UTP  5 1 1 V 
and LTP  5 2 1 V, then H 5 2 V. In this case, the Schmitt trigger is immune to 
false triggering as long as the peak-to-peak noise voltage is less than 2 V.
Noninverting Circuit
Figure 20-19 a shows a noninverting Schmitt trigger.  The input/output response 
has a hysteresis loop, as shown in Fig. 20-19 b. Here is how the circuit works: If 
the output is positively saturated in Fig. 20-19 a, the feedback voltage to the non-
inverting input is positive, which reinforces the positive saturation. Similarly, if 
the output is negatively saturated, the feedback voltage to the noninverting input 
is negative, which reinforces the negative saturation.
Assume that the output is negatively saturated. The feedback voltage 
will hold the output in negative saturation until the input voltage becomes slightly 
more positive than UTP. When this happens, the output switches from negative 
to positive saturation. Once in positive saturation, the output stays there until the 
input voltage becomes slightly less than LTP. Then, the output can change back 
to the negative state.
The equations for the trip points of a noninverting Schmitt trigger are 
given by:
UTP 5   R1 ___ R2   Vsat (20-10)
LTP  5   2R1 — R2   Vsat (20-11)
The ratio of R1 to R2 determines how much hysteresis the Schmitt trigger has. A 
designer can create enough hysteresis to prevent unwanted noise triggers.
Speed-Up Capacitor
Besides suppressing the effects of noise, positive feedback speeds up the switching 
of output states. When the output voltage begins to change, this change is fed back 
to the noninverting input and amplifi  ed, forcing the output to change faster. Some-
times a capacitor C2 is connected in parallel with R2, as shown in Fig. 20-20 a. +

Application Example 20-6
If Vsat 5 13.5 V , what are the trip points and hysteresis in Fig. 20-21?Known as a speed-up capacitor,  it helps to cancel the bypass circuit formed by 
the stray capacitance across R1. This stray capacitance C1 has to be charged before 
the noninverting input voltage can change. The speed-up capacitor supplies this 
charge.
To neutralize the stray capacitance, the minimum speed-up capacitance 
must be at least:
C2 5 R1 ___ R2   C1 (20-12)
As long as C2 is equal to or greater than the value given by Eq. (20-12), the output 
will switch states at maximum speed. Since a designer often has to estimate the 
stray capacitance C1, he or she usually makes C2 at least two times larger than the 
value given by Eq. (20-12). In typical circuits, C2 is from 10 to 100 pF.Figure 20-20   Speed-up capacitor compensates for stray capacitance.

An ordinary comparator indicates when the input voltage exceeds a certain limit 
or threshold. A window comparator  (also called a double-ended limit detec-
tor) detects when the input voltage is between two limits called the window.  To 
create a window comparator, we will use two comparators with different 
thresholds.
Low Output between Limits
Figure 20-22 a shows a window comparator that can produce a low output voltage 
when the input voltage is between a lower and an upper limit. The circuit has an 
LTP and a UTP. The reference voltages can be derived from voltage dividers, 
zener diodes, or other circuits. Figure 20-22 b shows the input/output response of

SOLUTION   With Eq. (20-4), the feedback fraction is:

With Eqs. (20-6) and (20-7), the trip points are:
UTP  5 0.0208(13.5 V)  5 0.281 V
LTP 5 2 0.0208(13.5 V)  5 2 0.281 V
With Eq. (20-9), the hysteresis is:
H 5 2(0.0208 V)(13.5 V)  5 0.562 V
This means that the Schmitt trigger of Fig. 20-21 can withstand a peak-to-peak 
noise voltage up to 0.562 V without false triggering.

47-kV resistor changed to 22 k V.870 Chapter 20the window comparator. When vin is less than LTP or greater than UTP, the output 
is high. When vin is between LTP and UTP, the output is low.
Here is the theory of operation: For this discussion, assume the following 
positive trip points: LTP  5 3 V and UTP  5 4 V. When vin , 3 V, comparator A1 
has a positive output and A2 has a negative output. Diode D1 is on and D2 is off. 
Therefore, the output voltage is high. Similarly, when vin .4 V, comparator A1 
has a negative output and A2 has a positive output. Diode D1 is off, D2 is on, and 
the output voltage is high. When 3 V  , vin , 4 V, A1 has a negative output, A2 has 
a negative output, D1 is off, D2 is off, and the output voltage is low.
High Output between Limits
Figure 20-23 a shows another window comparator. The circuit uses an LM339, 
which is a quad comparator that needs external pullup resistors. When used with 
a pullup supply of 15 V , the output can drive TTL circuits. A 115-V pullup 
 supply can be used when driving power MOSFET circuits. Figure 20-23 b shows 
the input/output response. As we can see, the output voltage is high when the input 
voltage is between the two limits.
For this discussion, we are assuming the same reference voltages as in the 
preceding example. When the input voltage is less than 3 V, the lower compara-
tor pulls the output down to zero. When the input voltage is greater than 4 V, the 
upper comparator pulls the output down to zero. When vin is between 3 and 4 V, the 
output transistor of each comparator is cut off, so the output is pulled up to 15 V.
20-5  The Integrator
An integrator  is a circuit that performs a mathematical operation called inte-
gration.  The most popular application of an integrator is in producing a ramp  of 
output voltage, which is a linearly increasing or decreasing voltage. The integrator 
is sometimes called the Miller integrator,  after the inventor.vinR

Figure 20-24 a is an op-amp integrator. As you can see, the feedback component 
is a capacitor instead of a resistor. The usual input to an integrator is a rectangular 
pulse like the one shown in Fig. 20-24 b. The width of this pulse is equal to T. When 
the pulse is low, vin 5 0. When the pulse is high, vin 5 Vin. Visualize this pulse 
 applied to the left end of R. Because of the virtual ground on the inverting input, 
a high input voltage produces an input current of:
Iin 5   Vin ___ R  
All this input current goes into the capacitor. As a result, the capacitor charges and its 
voltage increases with the polarity shown in Fig. 20-24 a. The virtual ground implies 
that the output voltage equals the voltage across the capacitor. For a positive input 
voltage, the output voltage will increase negatively, as shown in Fig. 20-24 c.
Since a constant current is fl  owing into the capacitor, the charge Q in-
creases linearly with time. This means that the capacitor voltage increases linearly, 
which is equivalent to a negative ramp of output voltage, as shown in Fig. 20-24 c. 
At the end of the pulse period in Fig. 20-24 b, the input voltage returns to zero and 
the capacitor charging stops. Because the capacitor retains its charge, the output 
voltage remains constant at a negative voltage of 2V. The magnitude of this volt-
age is given by:
V 5 T ___ RC   Vin (20-13)
A fi  nal point: Because of the Miller effect, we can split the feedback 
capacitor into two equivalent capacitances, as shown in Fig. 20-24 d. The closed-
loop time constant /H9270 for the input bypass circuit is:
t 5 RC(AVOL 1 1) (20-14)Figure 20-24   (a) Integrator; ( b) typical input pulse; ( c) output ramp; ( d) input Miller capacitance is very large.

greater than the width of the input pulse (at least 10 times greater). As a formula:
t . 10T (20-15)
In the typical op-amp integrator, the closed-loop time constant is extremely long, 
so this condition is easily satisfi  ed.
Eliminating Output Off  set
The circuit of Fig. 20-24 a needs a slight modifi  cation to make it practical.  Because 
a capacitor is open to dc signals, there is no negative feedback at zero frequency. 
Without negative feedback, the circuit treats any input offset voltage as a valid 
input voltage. The result is that the capacitor charges and the output goes into 
positive or negative saturation, where it stays indefi  nitely.
One way to reduce the effect of input offset voltage is to decrease 
the voltage gain at zero frequency by inserting a resistor in parallel with the 
capacitor, as shown in Fig. 20-25 a. This resistor should be at least 10 times 
larger than the input resistor. If the added resistance equals 10 R, the closed-
loop voltage gain is 10 and the output offset voltage is reduced to an acceptable 
level. When a valid input voltage is present, the additional resistor has almost 
no  effect on the charging of a capacitor, so the output voltage is still almost a 
perfect ramp.
Another way to suppress the effect of input offset voltage is to use a 
JFET switch, as shown in Fig. 20-25 b. The reset voltage on the gate of the JFET 
is either 0 V or 2VCC, which is enough to cut off the JFET. Therefore, we can set 
the JFET to a low resistance when the integrator is idle and to a high resistance 
when the integrator is active.
The JFET discharges the capacitor in preparation for the next input pulse. 
Just before the beginning of the next input pulse, the reset voltage is made equal 
to 0 V. This discharges the capacitor. At the instant the next pulse begins, the reset 
voltage becomes 2VCC, which cuts off the JFET. The integrator then produces an 
output voltage ramp.

With op amps we can convert sine waves to rectangular waves, rectangular waves 
to triangular waves, and so on. This section is about some basic circuits that con-
vert an input waveform to an output waveform of a different shape.
Application Example 20-7
In Fig. 20-26, what is the output voltage at the end of the input pulse? If the 
741C has an open-loop voltage gain of 100,000, what is the closed-loop time 
constant of the integrator?
SOLUTION  With Eq. (20-13), the magnitude of the negative output voltage 
at the end of the pulse is:
V 5   1 ms ____________   (2 kV )(1 /H9262F)   (8 V)  5 4 V
With Eq. (20-14), the closed-loop time constant is:
/H9270 5 RC(AVOL 1 1) 5 (2 kV)(1 /H9262F)(100,001)  5 200 s
Since the pulse width of 1 ms is much smaller than the closed-loop time con-
stant, only the earliest part of an exponential function is involved in the capacitor 
charging. Because the initial part of an exponential function is almost linear, the 
output voltage is almost a perfect ramp. Using an integrator to generate linear 
ramps is how the linear sweep voltages of an analog oscilloscope are produced 
and also can be used in timing circuits.

Figure 20-27 a shows a Schmitt trigger, and Fig. 20-27 b is the graph of output 
voltage versus input voltage. When the input signal is periodic  (repeating cycles), 
the Schmitt trigger produces a rectangular output, as shown. This assumes that the 
input signal is large enough to pass through both trip points of Fig. 20-27 c. When 
the input voltage exceeds UTP on the upward swing of the positive half-cycle, the 
output voltage switches to 2Vsat. One half-cycle later, the input voltage becomes 
more negative than LTP, and the output switches back to 1Vsat.
A Schmitt trigger always produces a rectangular output, regardless of the 
shape of the input signal. In other words, the input voltage does not have to be 
 sinusoidal. As long as the waveform is periodic and has an amplitude large enough 
to pass through the trip points, we get a rectangular output from the Schmitt trigger. 
This rectangular wave has the same frequency as the input signal.
As an example, Fig. 20-27 d shows a Schmitt trigger with trip points 
of approximately UTP  5 1 0.1 V and LTP  5 2 0.1 V. If the input voltage is 
repetitive and has a peak-to-peak value greater than 0.2 V, the output voltage is a 
rectangular wave with a peak-to-peak value of approximately 2 Vsat.
Rectangular to Triangular
In Fig. 20-28 a, a rectangular wave is the input to an integrator. Since the input 
voltage has a dc or average value of zero, the dc or average value of the output 
is also zero. As shown in Fig. 20-28 b, the ramp is decreasing during the pos-
itive half-cycle of input voltage and increasing during the negative half-cycle. Figure 20-27   Schmitt trigger always produces rectangular output.

It can be shown that the triangular output waveform has a peak-to-peak value of:

where T is the period of the signal. An equivalent expression in terms of fre-
quency is:

where Vp is the peak input voltage and f is the input frequency.
Triangle to Pulse
Figure 20-29 a shows a circuit that converts a triangular input to a rectangular 
output. By varying R2, we can change the width of the output pulses, which is 
equivalent to varying the duty cycle. In Fig. 20-29 b, W represents the width of 
the pulse and T is the period. As previously discussed, the duty cycle D is the 
width of the pulse divided by the period.
In some applications, we want to vary the duty cycle. The adjustable limit 
detector of Fig. 20-29 a is ideal for this purpose. With this circuit, we can move the 
trip point from zero to a positive level. When the triangular input  voltage exceeds Figure 20-28   (a) Square wave into integrator produces triangular output; ( b) input and output waveforms.

With positive feedback, we can build oscillators,  circuits that generate or create 
an output signal with no external input signal. This section discusses some op-amp 
circuits that can generate nonsinusoidal signals.
Relaxation Oscillator
In Fig. 20-32 a, there is no input signal. Nevertheless, the circuit produces a rec-
tangular output signal. This output is a square wave that swings between 2Vsat
and 1Vsat. How is this possible? Assume that the output of Fig. 20-32 a is in pos-
itive saturation. Because of feedback resistor R, the capacitor will charge expo-
nentially toward 1Vsat, as shown in Fig. 20-32 b. But the capacitor voltage never 
reaches 1Vsat because the voltage crosses the UTP. When this happens, the output 
square wave switches to 2Vsat.
With the output now in negative saturation, the capacitor discharges, as 
shown in Fig. 20-32 b. When the capacitor voltage crosses through zero, the capac-
itor starts charging negatively toward 2Vsat. When the capacitor voltage crosses 
the LTP, the output square wave switches back to 1Vsat. The cycle then repeats.
SOLUTION   When the wiper is at the middle of its range, it has a resistance of 5 k V. This means that the reference 
 voltage is :
vref 5   5 kV ______ 15 kV   15 V  5 5 V
The period of the signal is:
T 5   1 ______ 1 kHz   5 1000 /H9262s
Figure 20-31 b shows this value. It takes 500 /H9262s for the input voltage to increase from 27.5 to 17.5 V because this is 
half of the cycle. The trip point of the comparator is 15 V . This means that the output pulse has a width of W, as shown in 
Fig. 20-31 b.
 Because of the geometry of Fig. 20-31 b, we can set up a proportion between voltage and time as follows:
  W/2 ______ 500 /H9262s   5   7.5 V  2 5 V ___________  15 V  
Solving for W gives:
W 5 167 /H9262s
The duty cycle is:
D 5   167 /H9262s — 1000 /H9262s   5 0.167
 In Fig. 20-31 a, moving the wiper down will increase the reference voltage and decrease the output duty cycle. 
Moving the wiper up will decrease the reference voltage and increase the output duty cycle. For all values given in 
Fig. 20-31 a, the duty cycle can vary from 0 to 50 percent.
PRACTICE PROBLEM 20-9   Repeat Application Example 20-9 using an input frequency of 2 kHz.878 Chapter 20Because of the continuous charging and discharging of the capacitor, 
the output is a rectangular wave with a duty cycle of 50 percent. By analyzing the 
 exponential charge and discharge of the capacitor, we can derive this formula for 
the period of the rectangular output:
T 5 2RC ln   1 1 B ______ 1 2 B   (20-18)
where B is the feedback fraction given by:
B 5   R1 _______ R11 R2  
Equation (20-18) uses the natural logarithm,  which is a logarithm to base e. A 
scientifi  c calculator or table of natural logarithms must be used with this equation.
Figure 20-32 a is called a relaxation oscillator,  defi  ned as a circuit that 
generates an output signal whose frequency depends on the charging of a capac-
itor. If we increase the RC time constant, it takes longer for the capacitor voltage 
to reach the trip points. Therefore, the frequency is lower. By making R adjustable, 
we can get a 50 : 1 tuning range.
Generating Triangular Waves
By cascading a relaxation oscillator and an integrator, we get a circuit that pro-
duces the triangular output shown in Fig. 20-33. The rectangular wave out of Figure 20-32   (a) Relaxation oscillator; ( b) capacitor charging and output waveform.

In Fig. 20-35 a, the output of a noninverting Schmitt trigger is a rectangular wave 
that drives an integrator. The output of the integrator is a triangular wave. This 
triangular wave is fed back and drives the Schmitt trigger. So we have a very in-
teresting circuit. The fi  rst stage drives the second, and the second drives the fi  rst.

SOLUTION  With the equations shown in Fig. 20-33, we can analyze the cir-
cuit. In Application Example 20-10, we calculated a feedback fraction of 0.9 and 
a period of 589 /H9262s. Now, we can calculate the peak-to-peak value of the triangular

The circuit generates a square wave with a peak-to-peak value of approximately 
27 V and a triangular wave with a peak-to-peak value of 39.8 mV .
PRACTICE PROBLEM 20-11   Repeat Application Example 20-11 with 
the 18-k V  resistor in Fig. 20-34 changed to 10 k V.Nonlinear Op-Amp Circuit Applications 881Likewise, when the output is high, the input must decrease to the LTP to switch 
the output to low.
When the Schmitt trigger output is low in Fig. 20-35 c, the integrator 
produces a positive ramp, which increases until it reaches the UTP. At this point, 
the output of the Schmitt trigger switches to the high state and the triangular wave 
 reverses direction. The negative ramp then decreases until it reaches the LTP, 
where another Schmitt output change takes place.
In Fig. 20-35 c, the peak-to-peak value of the triangular wave equals the 
difference between the UTP and the LTP. We can derive this equation for the fre-
quency:

20-9  Active-Diode Circuits
Op amps can enhance the performance of diode circuits. For one thing, an op 
amp with negative feedback reduces the effect of the knee voltage, allowing us 
to rectify, peak-detect, clip, and clamp low-level signals (those with amplitudes 
less than the knee voltage). And because of their buffering action, op amps can 
eliminate the effects of the source and load on diode circuits.
Half-Wave Rectiﬁ  er
Figure 20-36 is an active half-wave rectifi  er. When the input signal goes positive, 
the output goes positive and turns on the diode. The circuit then acts like a volt-
age follower, and the positive half-cycle appears across the load resistor. When 
Application Example 20-12
The triangular-wave generator of Fig. 20-35 a has these circuit values: R1 5 1 kV, 
R2 5 100 k V, R3 5 10 kV, R4 5 100 k V, and C 5 10 /H9262F. What is the peak-to-
peak output if Vsat 5 13 V? What is the frequency of the triangular wave?
SOLUTION  With the equations shown in Fig. 20-35, the UTP has a value of:
UTP  5   1 kV _______ 100 k V   (13 V)  5 0.13 V

C to 1 μF. Calculate Vout(p-p)  and the output frequency.882 Chapter 20the input goes negative, the op-amp output goes negative and turns off the diode. 
Since the diode is open, no voltage appears across the load resistor. The fi  nal out-
put is almost a perfect half-wave signal.
There are two distinct modes  or regions of operation. First, when the input 
voltage is positive, the diode is conducting and the operation is linear. In this case, 
the output voltage is fed back to the input, and we have negative feedback. Second, 
when the input voltage is negative, the diode is nonconducting and the feedback 
path is open. In this case, the op-amp output is isolated from the load resistor.
The high open-loop voltage gain of the op amp almost eliminates the 
 effect of the knee voltage. For instance, if the knee voltage is 0.7 V and AVOL is 
100,000, the input voltage that just turns on the diode is 7 /H9262V.
The closed-loop knee voltage is given by:
VK(CL) 5   VK _____ AVOL  
where VK 5 0.7 V for a silicon diode. Because the closed-loop knee voltage is 
so small, the active half-wave rectifi  er may be used with low-level signals in the 
 microvolt region.
Active Peak Detector
To peak-detect small signals, we can use an active peak detector  like the one 
shown in Fig. 20-37 a. Again, the closed-loop knee voltage is in the microvolt 
region, which means that we can peak-detect low-level signals. When the diode is 
on, the negative feedback produces a Thevenin output impedance that approaches 
zero. This means that the charging time constant is very low, so the capacitor can 
quickly charge to the positive peak value. When the diode is off, the capacitor has 
to discharge through RL. Because the discharging time constant RLC can be made 
much longer than the period of the input signal, we can get almost perfect peak 
detection of low-level signals.
There are two distinct regions of operation. First, when the input voltage 
is positive, the diode is conducting and the operation is linear. In this case, the 
 capacitor charges to the peak of the input voltage. Second, when the input voltage 
is negative, the diode is nonconducting and the feedback path is open. In this case, 
the capacitor discharges through the load resistor. As long as the discharging time 
constant is much greater than the period of the input signal, the output voltage will 
be approximately equal to the peak value of the input voltage.
If the peak-detected signal has to drive a small load, we can avoid  loading 
effects by using an op-amp buffer. For instance, if we connect point A of Fig. 20-
37a to point B of Fig. 20-37 b, the voltage follower isolates the small load resistor 
from the peak detector. This prevents the small load resistor from discharging the 
capacitor too quickly.
At a minimum, the RLC time constant should be at least 10 times longer 
than the period T of the lowest input frequency. In symbols:

AVOLFigure 20-36   Active half-wave rectiﬁ  er.Nonlinear Op-Amp Circuit Applications 883If this condition is satisfi  ed, the output voltage will be within 5 percent of the peak 
input. For instance, if the lowest frequency is 1 kHz, the period is 1 ms. In this case, 
the RLC time constant should be at least 10 ms for an error of less than 5 percent.
Often, a reset  is included with an active peak detector, as shown in 
Fig. 20-37 c. When the reset input is low, the transistor switch is off. This allows 
the circuit to work as previously described. When the reset input is high, the tran-
sistor switch is closed. This rapidly discharges the capacitor. The reason you may 
need a reset is because the long discharge time constant means that the capacitor 
will hold its charge for a long time, even though the input signal is removed. By 
using a high reset input, we can quickly discharge the capacitor in preparation for 
another input signal with a different peak value.
Active Positive Clipper
Figure 20-38 a is an active positive clipper.  With the wiper all the way to the 
left, vref is zero and the noninverting input is grounded. When vin is positive, the 
op-amp output is negative and the diode is conducting. The low impedance of 
the diode produces heavy negative feedback because the feedback resistance ap-
proaches zero. For this condition, the output node is at virtual ground for all pos-
itive values of vin.
When vin goes negative, the output of the op amp is positive, which turns 
off the diode and opens the loop. When the loop is open, the virtual ground is lost 
and vout equals the negative half-cycle of input voltage. This is why the negative 
half-cycle appears at the output as shown.
We can adjust the clipping level by moving the wiper to get different 
 values of vref. In this way, we get the output waveform shown in Fig. 20-38 a. The 
reference level can be varied between 0 and 1V.
Figure 20-38 b shows an active circuit that clips on both half-cycles. 
 Notice the back-to-back zener diodes in the feedback loop. Below the zener volt-
age, the circuit has a closed-loop gain of R2/R1. When the output tries to exceed 
the zener voltage plus one forward diode drop, the zener diode breaks down and Figure 20-37   (a) Active peak detector; ( b) buff  er ampliﬁ  er; ( c) peak detector with reset.

peak value of the negative input half-cycle with the polarity shown in Fig. 20-39. 
Just beyond the negative input peak, the diode turns off, the loop opens, and the 
virtual ground is lost. In this case, the output voltage is the sum of the input volt-
age and the capacitor voltage:
vout 5 vin 1 Vp (20-21)
Since Vp is being added to a sinusoidal input voltage, the fi  nal output 
waveform is shifted positively through Vp, as shown in Fig. 20-39. The positively 
clamped waveform swings from 0 to 12Vp, which means that it has a peak-to-
peak value of 2 Vp, the same as the input. Again, the negative feedback reduces the 
knee voltage by a factor of approximately AVOL, which means that we can build 
excellent clampers for low-level inputs.
Figure 20-39 shows the op-amp output. During most of the cycle, the op 
amp operates in negative saturation. Right at the negative input peak, however, 
the op amp produces a sharp, positive-going pulse that replaces any charge lost by 
the clamping capacitor between negative input peaks.
20-10  The Diff  erentiator
A differentiator  is a circuit that performs a calculus operation called differentia-
tion. It produces an output voltage proportional to the instantaneous rate of change 
of the input voltage. Common applications of a differentiator are to detect the lead-
ing and trailing edges of a rectangular pulse or to produce a rectangular output from 
a ramp input.
RC Diff erentiator
An RC circuit like the one shown in Fig. 20-40 a can be used to differentiate an 
input signal. The typical input signal is a rectangular pulse, as shown in Fig. 20-40 b. 
The output of the circuit is a series of positive and negative spikes. The positive 
spike occurs at the same instant as the leading edge of the input, and the negative 
spike occurs at the same instant as the trailing edge. Spikes like these are useful sig-
nals because they indicate when the rectangular input signal starts and ends.
To understand how the RC differentiator works, look at Fig. 20-40 c. 
When the input voltage changes from 0 to 1V, the capacitor begins to charge

1 percent of the fi  nal voltage. To satisfy Kirchhoff’s voltage law, the voltage across 
the resistor of Fig. 20-40 a is:
vR 5 vin 2 vC
Since vC is initially zero, the output voltage suddenly jumps from 0 to V 
and then decays exponentially, as shown in Fig. 20-40 b. By a similar argument, 
the trailing edge of a rectangular pulse produces a negative spike. Incidentally, 
each spike in Fig. 20-40 b has a peak value of approximately V, the size of the 
voltage step.
If an RC differentiator is to produce narrow spikes, the time constant 
should be at least 10 times smaller than the pulse width T:
RC , 10T
If the pulse width is 1 ms, the RC time constant should be less than 0.1 ms. Fig-
ure 20-40 d shows an RC differentiator with a time constant of 0.1 ms. If you drive 
this circuit with any rectangular pulse that has T greater than 1 ms, the output is a 
series of sharp positive and negative voltage spikes.
Op-Amp Diff  erentiator
Figure 20-41 a shows an op-amp differentiator. Notice the similarity to the op-
amp integrator. The difference is that the resistor and capacitor are interchanged. 
 Because of the virtual ground, the capacitor current passes through the feedback 
resistor, producing a voltage across this resistor. The capacitor current is given by 
this fundamental relation:
i 5 C   dv ___ dt  
The quantity dv/dt  equals the slope of the input voltage.
One common application of the op-amp differentiator is to produce very 
narrow spikes, as shown in Fig. 20-41 b. The advantage of an op-amp differen-
tiator over a simple RC differentiator is that the spikes are coming from a low- 
impedance source, which makes driving typical load resistances easier.
Practical Op-Amp Diff  erentiator
The op-amp differentiator of Fig. 20-41 a has a tendency to oscillate. To avoid this, 
a practical op-amp differentiator usually includes some resistance in series with 
the capacitor, as shown in Fig. 20-42. A typical value for this added resistance 
is between 0.01 R and 0.1 R. With this resistor, the closed-loop voltage gain is 
 between 10 and 100. The effect is to limit the closed-loop voltage gain at higher 
frequencies, where the oscillation problem arises.

The Class-B or Class-AB amplifi  er has been the main choice of many designers 
for audio amplifi  ers. This linear amplifi  er confi  guration has been able to provide 
the necessary conventional performance and cost requirements. Now, products 
such as fl  at-screen TVs, and desktop PCs are driving the necessity for greater 
power output while maintaining or reducing the form-factor, without increasing 
costs. Portable powered devices, such as PDAs, cell phones, and notebook PCs, 
are demanding higher circuit effi  ciencies. Class-AB amplifi  ers have a maximum 
effi ciency of approximately 78 percent when used at a full power level. But under 
normal listening power levels, the effi  ciency drastically drops off. The effi  ciency 
of a Class-D amplifi  er can be over 90 percent for a range of output power levels. 
Due to very high effi  ciency and low heat dissipation, the Class-D amplifi  er is now 
challenging the Class-AB amplifi  ers in many applications. The Class-D amplifi  er 
demonstrates a practical application of many of the circuits and devices we have 
been discussing.
Discrete Class-D Ampliﬁ  ers
Instead of being biased for linear operation, a Class-D amplifi  er uses output tran-
sistors operated as switches. This enables each transistor to either be in a cutoff or 
saturated mode. When in cutoff, its current is zero. When it is saturated, the volt-
age across it is low. In each mode, its power dissipation is very low. This concept 
increases the circuit effi  ciency; therefore, it requires less power from the power 
supply and enables the use of smaller heat sinks for the amplifi  er.
A basic Class-D amplifi  er using a half-bridge output confi  guration is 
shown in Fig. 20-43. The amplifi  er consists of a comparator op amp driving 
two MOSFETs operating as switches. The comparator has two input signals: 
one  signal is the audio signal VA, and the other input is a triangle wave VT
with a much higher frequency. The voltage value out of the comparator VC will 
be approximately at either 1VDD or 2VSS. When VA . VT, VC 5 1VDD. When 
VA , VT, VC 5 2VSS.
The comparator’s positive or negative output voltage drives two com-
plementary common-source MOSFETs. When VC is positive, Q1 is switched on 
and Q2 is off. When VC is negative, Q2 is switched on and Q1 is off. The output 
voltage of each transistor will be slightly less than their 1VDD and 2VSS supply 
values. L1 and C1 act as a low-pass fi  lter. Most LC fi  lters for Class-D amplifi  ers 
are second-order low-pass designs. A typical fi  lter has a Butterworth response 
with a cutoff frequency at 40–50 kHz. When their values are properly chosen, this 
 fi lter passes the average value of the switching transistors’ output to the speaker. 
If the audio input signal VA were zero, VO would be a symmetrical square wave 
with an average value of zero volts.Figure 20-42   Resistance added to input to prevent oscillations.

+888 Chapter 20To illustrate the operation of this circuit, examine Fig. 20-44. A 1-kHz 
sine wave is applied to the input at VA, and a 20-kHz triangle wave is applied to 
input VT. In practice, the triangle-wave input frequency would be many times 
higher than in this illustration. A frequency of 250  –300 kHz is often used. The 
frequency should be as high as possible compared to the cutoff frequency fc of 
L1C1 for minimum output distortion. Also, note that the maximum voltage of VA 
is at approximately 70 percent of VT.
The resulting output VO of the switching transistors is a pulse-width-mod-
ulated (PWM)  waveform. The duty cycle of the waveform produces an output 
whose average value follows the audio input signal. This is shown in Fig. 20-45. 
When VA is at its positive peak, the width of the output pulse is maximum posi-
tive, producing a high positive average output. When VA is at its negative peak, 
the width of the output pulse is maximum negative, producing a high negative 
average output. When VA is a zero, the output is equally positive and negative, 
resulting in an average value of zero volts.

C1Nonlinear Op-Amp Circuit Applications 889Figure 20-46 shows an example of a Class-D amplifi  er using a full-bridge 
(H-bridge) topology. This confi  guration is also known as a bridge-tied load
(BTL). The full-bridge requires two half-bridges that supply pulses of opposite 
polarity to the fi  lter. For a given VDD and VSS power supply, this means that the 
full-bridge can deliver twice the output signal and four times the output power 
than a half-bridge confi  guration. While the half-bridge is simpler and requires less 
complicated gate drive circuits, the full-bridge can produce better audio perfor-
mance. The differential output structure of the bridge topology has the ability to 
cancel even-order harmonic distortion components and dc offsets. The full-bridge 
has an added advantage that it is possible to run from a single power supply ( VDD) 
without needing a large coupling capacitor.
In the half-bridge topology, some of the output energy is pumped back 
from the amplifi  er to the power supply during switching. This energy is primarily 
the result of the energy stored in the coil of the low-pass fi  lter. This results in bus Figure 20-45   Output waveform following the input.

the full-bridge are able to consume energy from the other side. This results in less 
energy pumped back toward the power supply.
For either topology, switching time error can cause nonlinearity of the 
PWM signal. To prevent shoot-through , a small amount of “dead-time” must 
be used to ensure that both power FETs on one leg of the H-bridge are not on 
at the same time. If this time gap is too large, it can cause a signifi  cant increase 
in the total harmonic distortion (THD) at the output. High-frequency switching 
of the output circuit can also create electromagnetic interference (EMI). There-
fore, it is important to keep leads, circuit traces, and connecting wires as short 
as possible.
A variation of the Class-D amplifi  er is called a fi  lter-less Class-D 
 amplifi  er. This amplifi  er uses a different type of modulation technique than previ-
ously discussed. In this amplifi  er, when the input signal is positive, the output is 
a train of PWM pulses that switch between zero volts and 1VDD. When the input 
signal is negative, the output modulated pulse train switches between zero volts 
and 2VSS. When the input signal is zero, the output is zero rather than a symmet-
rical square wave. This helps eliminate the need for a low-pass fi  lter connected 
to the speaker.
IC Class-D Ampliﬁ  ers
For low-power Class-D amplifi  ers, packaging all of the required circuits into one 
integrated circuit has many advantages. The LM48511 is an example of a Class-D 
IC amplifi  er that combines a switching current-mode boost converter, along with 
a high effi  ciency Class-D audio amplifi  er. The Class-D amplifi  er can provide 3W 
of continuous power into an 8 V speaker and uses low-noise PWM architecture 
that eliminates the need for an output LC low-pass fi  lter. The LM48511 is de-
signed for portable devices, such as GPS, mobile phones, and MP3 players. Its 
80% 5 V effi  ciency rating allows it to extend battery life as compared to Class-AB 
amplifi  ers. So how does this IC work?
Figure 20-47 shows a simplifi  ed block diagram of the LM48511 used 
in an audio amplifi  er application. Several internal functional blocks are shown 
inside the IC. Along with special input signal control connections, these blocks re-
quire an external power supply VDD, from 13.0 to 15.5 V, and a minimal amount 
of external components to operate.
The upper half of the LM48511 makes up the switching voltage regula-
tor. This type of regulator is called a boost converter because it is able to increase 
the level of applied supply voltage VDD. Details of switching regulators will be 
explained in a later chapter, but let’s look at its basic operation.
The switching boost voltage regulator is composed of an internal oscilla-
tor, modulator and FET, along with external components L1, D1, C2 and a voltage 
divider network of R1 through R3. The upper oscillator block drives the modu-
lator at a frequency of 1 MHz. The modulator then drives the internal switching 
FET with a variable duty cycle 1 MHz waveform. A feedback signal FB to the 
modulator enables the duty cycle to change depending on whether more or less 
output voltage is needed. When the FET is on, current fl  ows through L1 and en-
ergy is stored in its magnetic fi  eld. When the FET switches off, the magnetic fi  eld 
around L1 collapses, inducing a voltage across it. This voltage is series adding 
with the input voltage VDD. Capacitor C2 charges up through the Schottky diode 
D1 to a value of ( VDD 1 VL) 1 Vdiode. Depending on which feedback resistor, 
R1 or R2, is used, the boosted voltage will be fi  ltered by C2 and connected to the 
amplifi  er voltage input points V1 and PV1. When VDD is 5 V, the boosted output 
voltage is approximately 7.8 V. To save battery power, the boost circuit can be 
disabled by a control signal to the modulator. This situation would occur when 
only a small output power level is needed; therefore, the boosted voltage is not Nonlinear Op-Amp Circuit Applications 891needed.  Because of the high switching frequency, it is recommended that mul-
ti-layer  ceramic capacitors with low ESR (equivalent series resistance) be used in 
the converter and C2 be a single low ESR tantalum capacitor.
As shown in Fig. 20-47, the lower half of the LM48511 is the Class-D 
amplifi  er. This IC uses a fully differential amplifi  er on the input and output. This 
results in a typical common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of 73 dB. The gain 
of the differential amplifi  er is set by four external resistors. These include input 
resistors, R5 and R7, and feedback resistors, R6 and R8. The IC’s voltage gain is 
determined by:

CINFigure 20-47   Typical LM48511 Audio Ampliﬁ  er Application Circuit.892 Chapter 20To decrease the amplifi  er’s THD and increase the CMRR, carefully 
matched precision resistors with a 1% or better tolerance should be used. Also, to 
increase the amplifi  er’s noise rejection, these resistors should be placed as close 
to the IC’s input connections as possible. When required, the two input capacitors 
Cin are used to block the dc component of the input audio source.
The output of the differential amplifi  er drives the lower modulator block. 
The LM48511 uses two pulse-width-modulation schemes: A fi  xed frequency 
mode ( FF) and a spread spectrum  (SS) mode. This mode is set by the SS/FF
control line which is connected to an internal oscillator. When this control line 
is grounded, the modulator output switches as a constant rate of 300 kHz. The 
amplifi  er’s output spectrum then consists of the 300 MHz fundamental frequency 
and harmonics associated with it.
When the SS/FF control line is connected to 1VDD, the modulator oper-
ates in a spread spectrum mode. The switching frequency of the modulator will 
randomly vary by 10% around a center frequency of 330 kHz. A fi  xed modulation 
frequency produces spectral energy at the fundamental frequency and harmonic 
multiples of the switching frequency. Spread spectrum modulation spreads the 
energy over a larger bandwidth without affecting the audio reproduction. This 
mode essentially eliminates the need for output fi  lters. 
The output of the modulator drives the internal H-bridge (full-bridge) 
power switching devices. If operating in the fi  xed frequency mode, the outputs 
switch from PV1 (regulated input voltage) to ground at the 300 kHz switching 
frequency. When the input signal is zero, outputs VLS1 and VLS2 switch with 
an in-phase 50% duty cycle rate, causing the two outputs to cancel. There is no 
effective voltage across the speaker and no load current. When the applied input 
signal level increases, the duty cycle of VLS1 increases and the duty cycle of VLS2
decreases. When the applied input signal decreases, the duty cycle of VLS1 de-
creases while the duty cycle of VLS2 increases. The difference between the duty 
cycle rates at each output determines the level and direction of current through 
the speaker.
Summary
SEC. 20-1   COMPARATORS 
WITH ZERO 
REFERENCE
A comparator with a reference volt-
age of zero is called a zero-crossing 
detector. Diode clamps are often 
used to protect the comparator 
against excessively large input volt-
ages. Comparators usually interface 
their outputs with digital circuits.
SEC. 20-2   COMPARATORS 
WITH NONZERO 
REFERENCES
In some applications, a threshold 
voltage diff  erent from zero may 
be preferred. Comparators with 
a nonzero reference voltage are 
sometimes called limit detectors. Although op amps may be used as 
comparators, IC comparators are 
optimized for this application by 
 removing the internal compensating 
capacitor. This increases the 
switching speed.
SEC. 20-3   COMPARATORS 
WITH HYSTERESIS
Noise is any kind of unwanted 
signal that is not derived from 
or harmonically related to the 
input signal. Because noise can 
cause false triggering of a compara-
tor, positive feedback is used to 
create hysteresis. This prevents 
noise from producing false triggering. 
The positive feedback also speeds 
up the switching between output 
states.SEC. 20-4   WINDOW 
COMPARATOR
A window comparator, also called a 
double-ended limit detector, detects 
when the input voltage is between 
two limits. To create the window, 
a window comparator uses two 
comparators with two diff  erent trip 
points.
SEC. 20-5  THE INTEGRATOR
An integrator is useful for converting 
rectangular pulses into linear ramps. 
Because of the large input Miller 
capacitance, only the earliest part 
of an exponential charge is used. 
Since this early part is almost linear, 
the output ramps are almost perfect. Nonlinear Op-Amp Circuit Applications 893(20-8)   Hysteresis:

SEC. 20-6   WAVEFORM 
CONVERSION
We can use a Schmitt trigger to con-
vert a sine wave to a rectangular wave. 
An integrator can convert a square 
wave to a triangular wave. With an 
adjustable resistor, we can control the 
duty cycle with a limit detector.
SEC. 20-7   WAVEFORM 
GENERATION
With positive feedback, we can build 
oscillators, circuits that generate or 
create an output signal with no exter-
nal input signal. A relaxation oscillator 
uses the charging of a capacitor to 
generate an output signal. By cas-
cading a relaxation oscillator and an integrator, we can produce a triangu-
lar output waveform.
SEC. 20-8   ANOTHER TRIANGU-
LAR GENERATOR
The output of a noninverting Schmitt 
trigger can be used to drive an inte-
grator. If the output of the integrator 
is used as the input to the Schmitt 
trigger, we have an oscillator that 
produces both square waves and 
triangular waves.
SEC. 20-9   ACTIVE-DIODE 
CIRCUITS
With op amps, we can build active half-
wave rectiﬁ  ers, peak detectors, clip-
pers, and clampers. In all these circuits, 
the closed-loop knee voltage equals 
the knee voltage divided by the open-
loop voltage gain. Because of this, we 
can process low-level signals.SEC. 20-10  THE 
DIFFERENTIATOR
When a square wave drives a dif-
ferentiator, the output is a series of 
narrow positive and negative voltage 
spikes. With an op amp, we can im-
prove the diff  erentiation and get a 
low output impedance.
SEC. 20-11  CLASS-D 
AMPLIFIER
The Class-D ampliﬁ  er uses output tran-
sistors operated as switches. Instead 
of operating in a linear region, these 
transistors are alternately driven into 
saturation and cutoff   by the output sig-
nal of a comparator circuit. The Class-D 
ampliﬁ  er is capable of very high circuit 
effi  ciencies and is gaining popularity 
in portable equipment needing audio 
ampliﬁ  cation.894 Chapter 20Self-Test

At frequencies under 1 MHz, we can use RC oscillators to 
produce almost perfect sine waves. These low-frequency 
oscillators use op amps and RC resonant circuits to determine 
the frequency of oscillation. Above 1 MHz, LC  oscillators are 
used. These high-frequency oscillators use transistors and LC 
resonant  circuits. This chapter also discusses a popular chip 
called the 555 timer. It is used in many applications to produce 
time delays, voltage-controlled oscillators, and modulated output 
signals. The chapter also covers an important communications 
circuit called the phase-locked loop (PLL) and concludes with the 
popular XR-2206 function generator IC.

Oscillation
To build a sinusoidal oscillator, we need to use an amplifi  er with positive feed-
back. The idea is to use the feedback signal in place of the input signal. If the 
feedback signal is large enough and has the correct phase, there will be an output 
signal even though there is no external input signal.
Loop Gain and Phase
Figure 21-l a shows an ac voltage source driving the input terminals of an ampli-
fi er. The amplifi  ed output voltage is:
vout 5 Av(vin)
This voltage drives a feedback circuit that is usually a resonant circuit. Because 
of this, we get maximum feedback at one frequency. In Fig. 21-1 a, the feedback 
voltage returning to point x is given by:
vf 5 AvB(vin)
where B is the feedback fraction.
If the phase shift through the amplifi  er and feedback circuit is equivalent 
to 0°, AvB(vin) is in phase with vin.
Suppose we connect point x to point y and simultaneously remove volt-
age source vin, then the feedback voltage AvB(vin) drives the input of the amplifi  er, 
as shown in Fig. 21-1 b.
What happens to the output voltage? If AvB is less than 1, AvB(vin) is 
less than vin and the output signal will die out, as shown in Fig. 21-1 c. However, 
if AvB is greater than 1, AvB(vin) is greater than vin and the output voltage builds 
up (Fig. 21-1 d). If AvB equals 1, then AvB(vin) equals vin and the output voltage 
is a steady sine wave like the one in Fig. 21-1 e. In this case, the circuit supplies 
its own input signal.
In any oscillator, the loop gain AvB is greater than 1 when the power is 
fi rst turned on. A small starting voltage is applied to the input terminals, and the 
output voltage builds up, as shown in Fig. 21-1 d. After the output voltage reaches 
a certain level, AvB automatically decreases to 1, and the peak-to-peak output 
becomes constant (Fig. 21-1 e).GOOD TO KNOW
In most oscillators, the feedback 
voltage is a fractional part of the 
output voltage. When this is the 
case, the voltage gain Av must 
be large enough to ensure that 
AvB 5 1. In other words, the 
amplifier voltage gain must at 
least be large enough to over-
come the losses in the feed-
back network. However, if an 
emitter follower is used as the 
amplifier, the feedback network 
must provide a slight amount 
of gain to ensure that AvB 5 1. 
For example, if the voltage gain 
Av of an emitter follower equals 
0.9, then B must equal 1/0.9 or 
1.11. RF communication circuits 
sometimes use oscillators that 
contain an emitter follower for 
the amplifier.

Where does the starting voltage come from? Every  resistor contains some free 
electrons. Because of the ambient temperature, these free electrons move ran-
domly in different directions and generate a noise voltage across the resistor. The 
motion is so random that it contains frequencies to over 1000 GHz. You can think 
of each resistor as a small ac voltage source producing all frequencies.
In Fig. 21-1 b, here is what happens: When you fi  rst turn on the power, 
the only signals in the system are the noise voltages generated by the resistors. 
These noise voltages are amplifi  ed and appear at the output terminals. The am-
plifi ed noise, which contains all frequencies, drives the resonant feedback circuit. 
By deliberate design, we can make the loop gain greater than 1 and the loop 
phase shift equal to 0° at the resonant frequency. Above and below the resonant 
frequency, the phase shift is different from 0°. As a result, oscillations will build 
up only at the resonant frequency of the feedback circuit.
AvB Decreases to Unity
There are two ways in which AvB can decrease to 1. Either Av can decrease or B
can decrease. In some oscillators, the signal is allowed to build up until clipping 
occurs because of saturation and cutoff. This is equivalent to reducing voltage 
gain Av. In other oscillators, the signal builds up and causes B to decrease before 
clipping occurs. In either case, the product AvB decreases until it equals 1.
Here are the key ideas behind any feedback oscillator:
1. Initially, loop gain AvB is greater than 1 at the frequency where the loop 
phase shift is 0°.
2. After the desired output level is reached, AvB must decrease to 1 by re-
ducing either Av or B.
21-2  The Wien-Bridge Oscillator
The Wien-bridge oscillator  is the standard oscillator circuit for low to moderate 
frequencies in the range of 5 Hz to about 1 MHz. It is often used in  commercial 
audio generators and is usually preferred for other low-frequency  applications.
Lag Circuit
The voltage gain of the bypass circuit of Fig. 21-2 a is:
vout ___ vin   5   XC __________  
 Ï— R2 1 XC2    
and the phase angle is:
/H9278 5 2arctan   R ___ XC  
where /H9278 is the phase angle between the output and the input.
Notice the minus sign in this equation for phase angle. It means that the 
output voltage lags the input voltage, as shown in Fig. 21-2 b. Because of this, a 
bypass circuit is also called a lag circuit.  In Fig. 21-2 b, the half circle shows the 
possible positions of the output phasor voltage. This implies that the output pha-
sor can lag the input phasor by an angle between 0° and 290°.(a)
(b)voutfvinvin voutR
C
fFigure 21-2   (a) Bypass capacitor; 
(b) phasor diagram.906 Chapter 21Lead Circuit
Figure 21-3 a shows a coupling circuit. The voltage gain in this circuit is:
  vout ___ vin   5   RC __________  
 Ï— R2 1 XC2    
and the phase angle is:
/H9278 5 arctan   XC ___ R  
Notice that the phase angle is positive. It means that the output voltage 
leads the input voltage, as shown in Fig. 21-3 b. Because of this, a coupling circuit 
is also called a lead circuit.  In Fig. 21-3 b, the half circle shows the possible posi-
tions of the output phasor voltage. This implies that the output phasor can lead the 
input phasor by an angle between 0° and 190°.
Coupling and bypass circuits are examples of phase-shifting circuits. 
These circuits shift the phase of the output signal either positive (leading) or neg-
ative (lagging) with respect to the input signal. A sinusoidal oscillator always uses 
some kind of phase-shifting circuit to produce oscillation at one frequency.
Lead-Lag Circuit
The Wien-bridge oscillator uses a resonant feedback circuit called a lead-lag 
 circuit  (Fig. 21-4). At very low frequencies, the series capacitor appears open 
to the input signal, and there is no output signal. At very high frequencies, the 
shunt capacitor looks shorted, and there is no output. In between these extremes, 
the output voltage reaches a maximum value (see Fig. 21-5 a). The frequency 
where the output is maximum is the resonant frequency fr. At this frequency, the 
feedback fraction B reaches a maximum value of 1⁄3.
Figure 21-5 b shows the phase angle of the output voltage versus input 
voltage. At very low frequencies, the phase angle is positive (leading). At very 
high frequencies, the phase angle is negative (lagging). At the resonant frequency, 
the phase shift is 0°. Figure 21-5 c shows the phasor diagram of the input and out-
put voltages. The tip of the phasor can lie anywhere on the dashed circle. Because 
of this, the phase angle may vary from 190° to 290°.
The lead-lag circuit of Fig. 21-4 acts like a resonant circuit. At the res-
onant frequency fr, the feedback fraction B reaches a maximum value of 1⁄3, and 
the phase angle equals 0°. Above and below the resonant frequency, the feedback 
fraction is less than 1⁄3, and the phase angle no longer equals 0°.
Formula for Resonant Frequency
By analyzing Fig. 21-4 with complex numbers, we can derive these two  equations:

Solving for fr gives:
fr 5   1 ______ 2pRC   (21-3)
How It Works
Figure 21-6 a shows a Wien-bridge oscillator. It uses positive and negative feed-
back because there are two paths for feedback. There is a path for positive feed-
back from the output through the lead-lag circuit to the noninverting input. There 
is also a path for negative feedback from the output through the voltage divider to 
the inverting input.
When the circuit is initially turned on, there is more positive feedback 
than negative feedback. This allows the oscillations to build up, as previously 
described. After the output signal reaches a desired level, the negative feedback 
becomes large enough to reduce loop gain AvB to 1.
Here is why AvB decreases to 1: At power-up, the tungsten lamp has a 
low resistance, and the negative feedback is small. For this reason, the loop gain is 
greater than 1, and the oscillations can build up at the resonant frequency. As the 
oscillations build up, the tungsten lamp heats slightly and its resistance increases. 
In most circuits, the current through the lamp is not enough to make the lamp 
glow, but it is enough to increase the resistance.
At some high output level, the tungsten lamp has a resistance of exactly 
R9. At this point, the closed-loop voltage gain from the noninverting input to the f

Av(CL) 5   2R9 — R9   1 1 5 3
Since the lead-lag circuit has a B of 1⁄3, the loop gain is:
Av(CL)B 5 3(1⁄3) 5 1
When the power is fi  rst turned on, the resistance of the tungsten lamp is 
less than R9. As a result, the closed-loop voltage gain from the noninverting input 
to the output is greater than 3 and Av(CL)B is greater than 1.
As the oscillations build up, the peak-to-peak output becomes large 
enough to increase the resistance of the tungsten lamp. When its resistance equals 
R9, the loop gain Av(CL)B is exactly equal to 1. At this point, the oscillations 
 become stable, and the output voltage has a constant peak-to-peak value.
Initial Conditions
At power-up, the output voltage is zero and the resistance of the tungsten lamp 
is less than R9, as shown in Fig. 21-7. When the output voltage increases, the 
resistance of the lamp increases, as shown in the graph. When the voltage across 
the tungsten lamp is V9, the tungsten lamp has a resistance of R9. This means that 
Av(CL) has a value of 3 and the loop gain is 1. When this happens, the output am-
plitude levels off and becomes constant.
Notch Filter
Figure 21-8 shows another way to draw the Wien-bridge oscillator. The lead-lag 
circuit is the left side of a bridge, and the voltage divider is the right side. This ac 
bridge, called a Wien bridge,  is used in other applications besides oscillators. The 
error voltage  is the output of the bridge. When the bridge approaches balance, the 
error voltage approaches zero.
The Wien bridge acts like a notch fi  lter,  a circuit with zero output at one 
particular frequency. For a Wien bridge, the notch frequency equals:
fr 5   1 ______ 2pRC   (21-4)
Because the required error voltage for the op amp is so small, the Wien bridge 
is almost perfectly balanced, and the oscillation frequency equals fr to a close 
 approximation.Rlamp

the  lamp voltage is expressed in rms volts, what is the output voltage of the

SOLUTION  In Fig. 21-9, the feedback resistance is 2 k V. Therefore, the os-
cillator output signal becomes constant when the lamp resistance equals 1 k V 
because this produces a closed-loop gain of 3.
In Fig. 21-10, a lamp resistance of 1 k V corresponds to a lamp voltage 
of 2 V rms. The lamp current is:

21-3  Other RC Oscillators
Although the Wien-bridge oscillator is the industry standard for frequencies up 
to 1 MHz, other RC oscillators can be used in different applications. This section 
discusses two other basic designs, called the twin-T oscillator  and the phase-
shift oscillator.
Twin-T Filter
Figure 21-11 a is a twin-T fi  lter. A mathematical analysis of this circuit shows that 
it acts like a lead-lag circuit with a changing phase angle, as shown in Fig. 21-11 b. 
Again, there is a frequency fr where the phase shift equals 0°. In Fig. 21-11 c, the 
voltage gain equals 1 at low and high frequencies. In between, there is a frequency fr 
at which the voltage gain drops to 0. The twin-T fi  lter is another example of a notch 
fi lter because it can notch out frequencies near fr. The equation for the resonant fre-
quency of a twin-T fi  lter is the same as for a Wien-bridge oscillator:
fr 5   1 ______ 2/H9266RC  
Twin-T Oscillator
Figure 21-12 shows a twin-T oscillator. The positive feedback to the noninverting 
input is through a voltage divider. The negative feedback is through the twin-T 
 fi lter. When power is fi  rst turned on, the lamp resistance R2 is low and the positive 
feedback is maximum. As the oscillations build up, the lamp resistance increases 
and the positive feedback decreases. As the feedback decreases, the oscillations 
level off and become constant. In this way, the lamp stabilizes the level of the 
output voltage.Oscillators 911In the twin-T fi  lter, resistance R/2 is adjusted. This is necessary because 
the circuit oscillates at a frequency slightly different from the ideal resonant fre-
quency. To ensure that the oscillation frequency is close to the notch frequency, 
the voltage divider should have R2 much larger than R1. As a guide, R2/R1 is in 
the range of 10 to 1000. This forces the oscillator to operate at a frequency near 
the notch frequency.
Although it is occasionally used, the twin-T oscillator is not a popular 
circuit because it works well only at one frequency. That is, unlike the Wien-
bridge oscillator, it cannot be easily adjusted over a large frequency range.
Phase-Shift Oscillator
Figure 21-13 is a phase-shift oscillator with three lead circuits in the feedback 
path. As you recall, a lead circuit produces a phase shift between 0° and 90°, 
depending on the frequency. At some frequency, the total phase shift of the three 
lead circuits equals 180° (approximately 60° each). Some phase-shift oscillator 
confi gurations use four lead circuits to produce the required 180° of phase shift. 
The amplifi  er has an additional 180° of phase shift because the signal drives the 
inverting input. As a result, the phase shift around the loop will be 360°, equivalent 
to 0°. If AvB is greater than 1 at this particular frequency, oscillations can start.
Figure 21-14 shows an alternative design. It uses three lag circuits. The 
operation is similar. The amplifi  er produces 180° of phase shift, and the lag cir-
cuits contribute 2180° at some higher frequency to get a loop phase shift of 0°. 
If AvB is greater than 1 at this frequency, oscillations can start. The phase-shift 
oscillator is not a popular circuit. Again, the main problem with the circuit is that 
it cannot be easily adjusted over a large frequency range.vin voutR

Although it is superb at low frequencies, the Wien-bridge oscillator is not suited to 
high frequencies (well above 1 MHz). The main problem is the limited bandwidth 
(funity) of the op amp.
LC Oscillators
One way to produce high-frequency oscillations is with an LC oscillator, a circuit 
that can be used for frequencies between 1 and 500 MHz. This frequency range is 
beyond the funity of most op amps. This is why a bipolar junction transistor or an 
FET is typically used for the amplifi  er. With an amplifi  er and LC tank circuit, we 
can feed back a signal with the right amplitude and phase to sustain oscillations.
The analysis and the design of high-frequency oscillators are diffi  cult. 
Why? Because at higher frequencies, stray capacitances and lead inductances be-
come very important in determining the oscillation frequency, feedback fraction, 
output power, and other ac quantities. This is why many designers use computer 
approximations for an initial design and adjust the built-up oscillator as needed to 
get the desired performance.
CE Connection
Figure 21-15 shows a Colpitts oscillator.  The voltage-divider bias sets up a qui-
escent operating point. The RF choke has a very high inductive reactance, so it 
appears open to the ac signal. The circuit has a low-frequency voltage gain of 
rc/re9, where rc is the ac collector resistance. Because the RF choke appears open 
to the ac signal, the ac collector resistance is primarily the ac resistance of the 
resonant tank circuit. This ac resistance has a maximum value at resonance.–

C1Figure 21-15   Colpitts oscillator.Oscillators 913You will encounter many variations of the Colpitts oscillator. One way 
to recognize a Colpitts oscillator is by the capacitive voltage divider formed by 
C1 and C2. It produces the feedback voltage necessary for oscillations. In other 
kinds of oscillators, the feedback voltage is produced by transformers, inductive 
voltage dividers, and so on.
AC-Equivalent Circuit
Figure 21-16 is a simplifi  ed ac-equivalent circuit for the Colpitts oscillator. The cir-
culating or loop current in the tank fl  ows through C1 in series with C2. Notice that 
vout equals the ac voltage across C1. Also, the feedback voltage vf appears across 
C2. This feedback voltage drives the base and sustains the oscillations  developed 
across the tank circuit, provided there is enough voltage gain at the  oscillation 
frequency. Since the emitter is at ac ground, the circuit is a CE  connection.
Resonant Frequency
Most LC oscillators use tank circuits with a Q greater than 10. Because of this, we 
can calculate the approximate resonant frequency as:
fr 5   1 ________ 2p  Ï— LC     (21-5)
This is accurate to better than 1 percent when Q is greater than 10.
The capacitance to use in Eq. (21-5) is the equivalent capacitance through 
which the circulating current passes. In the Colpitts tank circuit of Fig. 21-16, the 
circulating current fl  ows through C1 in series with C2. Therefore, the equivalent 
capacitance is:
C 5   C1C2 _______ C1 1 C2   (21-6)
For instance, if C1 and C2 are 100 pF each, you would use 50 pF in Eq. (21-5).
Starting Condition
The required starting condition for any oscillator is AvB . 1 at the resonant fre-
quency of the tank circuit. This is equivalent to Av . 1/B. In Fig. 21-16, the output 
voltage appears across C1 and the feedback voltage appears across C2. The feed-
back fraction in this type of oscillator is given by:

For the oscillator to start, the minimum voltage gain is:

the amplifi  er. There are base and collector bypass circuits in a bipolar amplifi  er. vout

GOOD TO KNOW
In reference to Fig. 21-15, it 
is important to realize that 
the net reactance of the L-C2 
branch  appears inductive at the 
 resonant frequency of the tank. 
Furthermore, the net inductive 
reactance of the L-C2 branch 
equals the capacitive reactance 
of C1.914 Chapter 21If the cutoff frequencies of these bypass circuits are greater than the oscillation 
frequency, Av is approximately equal to rc/re9. If the cutoff frequencies are lower 
than  the oscillation frequency, the voltage gain is less than rc/re9 and there is 
additional phase shift through the amplifi  er.
Output Voltage
With light feedback (small B), Av is only slightly larger than 1/ B, and the opera-
tion is approximately Class-A. When you fi  rst turn on the power, the oscillations 
build up, and the signal swings over more and more of the ac load line. With this 
increased signal swing, the operation changes from small-signal to large-signal. 
When this happens, the voltage gain decreases slightly. With light feedback, the 
value of AvB can decrease to 1 without excessive clipping.
With heavy feedback (large B), the large feedback signal drives the base 
of Fig. 21-15 into saturation and cutoff. This charges capacitor C3, producing 
negative dc clamping at the base. The negative clamping automatically adjusts the 
value of AvB to 1. If the feedback is too heavy, you may lose some of the output 
voltage because of stray power losses.
When you build an oscillator, you can adjust the feedback to maximize 
the output voltage. The idea is to use enough feedback to start under all conditions 
(different transistors, temperature, voltage, and so on), but not so much that you 
lose output signal. Designing reliable high-frequency oscillators is a challenge. 
Most designers use computers to model high-frequency oscillators.
Coupling to a Load
The exact frequency of oscillation depends on the Q of the circuit and is given by:
fr 5   1 _______ 2p Ï— LC      Ï—
   Q2 ______ Q2 1 1     (21-9)
When Q is greater than 10, this equation simplifi  es to the ideal value given by 
Eq. (21-5). If Q is less than 10, the frequency is lower than the ideal value. Fur-
thermore, a low Q may prevent the oscillator from starting because it may reduce 
the high-frequency voltage gain below the starting value of 1/ B.
Figure 21-17 a shows one way to couple the oscillator signal to the load 
resistance. If the load resistance is large, it will load the resonant circuit only 
slightly and the Q will be greater than 10. But if the load resistance is small, Q 
drops under 10 and the oscillations may not start. One solution to a small load 
 resistance is to use a small capacitance C4, one whose XC is large compared with 
the load resistance. This prevents excessive loading of the tank circuit.
Figure 21-17 b shows link coupling, another way of coupling the signal 
to a small load resistance. Link coupling means using only a few turns on the 
secondary winding of an RF transformer. This light coupling ensures that the 
load resistance will not lower the Q of the tank circuit to the point at which the 
oscillator will not start.
Whether capacitive or link coupling is used, the loading effect is kept 
as small as possible. In this way, the high Q of the tank ensures an undistorted 
sinusoidal output with a reliable start for the oscillations.
CB Connection
When the feedback signal in an oscillator drives the base, a large Miller capacitance 
appears across the input. This produces a relatively low cutoff frequency, which 
means that the voltage gain may be too low at the desired resonant frequency.
To get a higher cutoff frequency, the feedback signal can be applied to 
the emitter, as shown in Fig. 21-18. Capacitor C3 ac-grounds the base, and so the 
transistor acts like a common-base (CB) amplifi  er. A circuit like this can oscillate GOOD TO KNOW
In Fig. 21-15, the current in the 
L-C 2 branch lags the tank volt-
age by 90° at resonance, since 
the net reactance of this branch 
is inductive. Furthermore, since 
the voltage across C2 must lag 
its current by 90°, the feedback 
voltage must lag the tank volt-
age (ac collector voltage) by 
180°. As you can see, the feed-
back network provides the re-
quired 180° phase shift of vout.Oscillators 915C3R1+VCC

at higher frequencies because its high-frequency gain is larger than that of a CE 
oscillator. With link coupling on the output, the tank is lightly loaded, and the 
 resonant frequency is given by Eq. (21-5).
The feedback fraction is slightly different in a CB oscillator. The out-
put voltage appears across C1 and C2 in series, and the feedback voltage appears 
across C2. Ideally, the feedback fraction is:
B 5   C1 _______ C1 1 C2   (21-10)916 Chapter 21For the oscillations to start, Av must be greater than 1/ B. As an approximation, this 
means that:
Av(min) 5   C1 1 C2 _______  C1   (21-11)
This is an approximation because it ignores the input impedance of the emitter, 
which is in parallel with C2.
FET Colpitts Oscillator
Figure 21-19 is an example of an FET Colpitts oscillator in which the feedback 
signal is applied to the gate. Since the gate has a high input resistance, the loading 
effect on the tank circuit is much less than with a bipolar junction transistor. The 
feedback fraction for the circuit is:
B 5   C1 ___ C2   (21-12)
The minimum gain needed to start the FET oscillator is:
Av(min) 5   C2 ___ C1   (21-13)
In an FET oscillator, the low-frequency voltage gain is gmrd. Above the 
cutoff frequency of the FET amplifi  er, the voltage gain decreases. In Eq. (21-13), 
Av(min) is the voltage gain at the oscillation frequency. As a rule, we try to keep the 
oscillation frequency lower than the cutoff frequency of the FET amplifi  er. Oth-
erwise, the additional phase shift through the amplifi  er may prevent the oscillator 
from starting.fr =

What is the frequency of oscillation in Fig. 21-20? What is the feedback fraction? 
How much voltage gain does the circuit need to start oscillating?
SOLUTION   This is a Colpitts oscillator using the CE connection of a transis-
tor. With Eq. (21-6), the equivalent capacitance is:
C 5   (0.001 /H9262F)(0.01 /H9262F)  _________________   0.001 /H9262F 1 0.01 /H9262F   5 909 pFOscillators 917
The inductance is 15 /H9262H. With Eq. (21-5), the frequency of oscillation is:
fr 5   1 __________________   2/H9266 Ï——  (15 /H9262H)(909 pF)     5 1.36 MHz
With Eq. (21-7), the feedback fraction is:
B 5   0.001 /H9262F —  0.01 /H9262F   5 0.1
To start oscillating, the circuit needs a minimum voltage gain of:
Av(min) 5   0.01 /H9262F — 0.001 /H9262F   5 10
PRACTICE PROBLEM 21-3   In Fig. 21-20, what is the approximate value 
that the inductor L would need to equal for an output frequency of 1 MHz?
21-5  Other LC Oscillators
The Colpitts oscillator is the most widely used LC oscillator. The capacitive volt-
age divider in the resonant circuit is a convenient way to develop the feedback 
voltage. But other kinds of oscillators can also be used.
Armstrong Oscillator
Figure 21-21 is an example of an Armstrong oscillator.  In this circuit, the col-
lector drives an LC resonant tank. The feedback signal is taken from a small sec-
ondary winding and fed back to the base. There is a phase shift of 180° in the 
transformer, which means that the phase shift around the loop is zero. If we ignore 
the loading effect of the base, the feedback fraction is:
B 5   M __ L   (21-14)
where M is the mutual inductance and L is the primary inductance. For the Arm-
strong oscillator to start, the voltage gain must be greater than 1/ B.VCC

 signal. This is how you can recognize variations of this basic circuit. The small 
secondary winding is sometimes called a tickler coil  because it feeds back the 
signal that sustains the oscillations. The resonant frequency is given by Eq. (21-5), 
using the L and C shown in Fig. 21-21. As a rule, you do not see the  Armstrong 
 oscillator used much because many designers avoid transformers whenever 
 possible.
Hartley Oscillator
Figure 21-22 is an example of the Hartley oscillator.  When the LC tank is reso-
nant, the circulating current fl  ows through L1 in series with L2. The equivalent L 
to use in Eq. (21-5) is:
L 5 L1 1 L2 (21-15)
In a Hartley oscillator, the feedback voltage is developed by the inductive voltage 
divider L1 and L2. Since the output voltage appears across L1 and the feedback 
voltage appears across L2, the feedback fraction is:
B 5   L2 — L1   (21-16)
As usual, this ignores the loading effects of the base. For oscillations to start, the 
voltage gain must be greater than 1/ B.
Often, a Hartley oscillator uses a single tapped inductor instead of two 
 separate inductors. Another variation sends the feedback signal to the emitter in-
stead of to the base. Also, you may see an FET used instead of a bipolar junction 
transistor. The output signal can be either capacitively coupled or link-coupled.RF

GOOD TO KNOW
In the Colpitts oscillator, the tank 
inductor is adjusted to vary the 
frequency of oscillation, whereas 
in the Hartley oscillator, the tank 
capacitor is adjusted to vary the 
 frequency of oscillation.Oscillators 919Clapp Oscillator
The Clapp oscillator  of Fig. 21-23 is a refi  nement of the Colpitts oscillator. The 
capacitive voltage divider produces the feedback signal as before. An additional 
capacitor C3 is in series with the inductor. Since the circulating tank current fl  ows 
through C1, C2, and C3 in series, the equivalent capacitance used to calculate the 
resonant frequency is:
C 5   1 _________________   1/C1 1 1/C2 1 1/C3   (21-17)
In a Clapp oscillator, C3 is much smaller than C1 and C2. As a result, C is approx-
imately equal to C3, and the resonant frequency is given by:
fr >   1 ________  2p  Ï— LC3     (21-18)
Why is this important? Because C1 and C2 are shunted by transistor and stray 
capacitances, these extra capacitances alter the values of C1 and C2 slightly. In a 
Colpitts oscillator, the resonant frequency therefore depends on the transistor and 
stray capacitances. But in a Clapp oscillator, the transistor and stray capacitances 
have no effect on C3, so the oscillation frequency is more stable and accurate. This 
is why you occasionally see the Clapp oscillator used.
Crystal Oscillator
When accuracy and stability of the oscillation frequency are important, a 
quartz-crystal oscillator  is used. In Fig. 21-24, the feedback signal comes from RF

XTAL ) acts like a large inductor in series with a small capacitor (similar to the 
Clapp). Because of this, the resonant frequency is almost totally unaffected by 
transistor and stray capacitances.
21-6  Quartz Crystals
When the frequency of oscillation needs to be accurate and stable, a crystal oscil-
lator is the natural choice. Electronic wristwatches and other critical timing appli-
cations use crystal oscillators because they provide an accurate clock frequency.
Piezoelectric Eff  ect
Some crystals found in nature exhibit the piezoelectric effect.  When you apply 
an ac voltage across them, they vibrate at the frequency of the applied voltage. 
Conversely, if you mechanically force them to vibrate, they generate an ac voltage 
of the same frequency. The main substances that produce the piezoelectric effect 
are quartz, Rochelle salts, and tourmaline.
Rochelle salts have the greatest piezoelectric activity. For a given ac 
voltage, they vibrate more than quartz or tourmaline. Mechanically, they are the 
weakest because they break easily. Rochelle salts have been used to make mi-
crophones, phonograph pickups, headsets, and loudspeakers. Tourmaline shows 
the least piezoelectric activity but is the strongest of the three. It is also the most 
expensive. It is occasionally used at very high frequencies.
Quartz is a compromise between the piezoelectric activity of Rochelle 
salts and the strength of tourmaline. Because it is inexpensive and readily availa-
ble in nature, quartz is widely used for RF oscillators and fi  lters.
Crystal Slab
The natural shape of a quartz crystal is a hexagonal prism with pyramids at the 
ends (see Fig. 21-25 a). To get a usable crystal out of this, a manufacturer slices 
Example 21-4 
If 50 pF is added in series with the 15- /H9262H inductor of Fig. 21-20, the circuit 
 becomes a Clapp oscillator. What is the frequency of oscillation?
SOLUTION   We can calculate the equivalent capacitance with Eq. (21-17):
C 5   1  _____________________________    1/0.001 /H9262F 1 1/0.01 /H9262F 1 1/50 pF   > 50 pF
Notice how the term 1/50 pF swamps the other values because the 50 pF is much 
smaller than the other capacitances. The frequency of oscillation is:
fr 5   1 __________________   2/H9266  Ï——  (15 /H9262H)(50 pF)     5 5.81 MHz
PRACTICE PROBLEM 21-4   Repeat Example 21-4 by replacing the 
50-pF capacitor with 120 pF.Oscillators 921a rectangular slab out of the natural crystal. Figure 21-25 b shows this slab with 
thickness t. The number of slabs we can get from a natural crystal depends on the 
size of the slabs and the angle of the cut.
For use in electronic circuits, the slab must be mounted between two 
metal plates, as shown in Fig. 21-25 c. In this circuit, the amount of crystal vibra-
tion depends on the frequency of the applied voltage. By changing the frequency, 
we can fi  nd resonant frequencies at which the crystal vibrations reach a maxi-
mum. Since the energy for the vibrations must be supplied by the ac source, the 
ac current is maximum at each resonant frequency.
Fundamental Frequency and Overtones
Most of the time, the crystal is cut and mounted to vibrate best at one of its 
 resonant frequencies, usually the fundamental frequency,  or lowest frequency. 
Higher resonant frequencies, called overtones,  are almost exact multiples of the 
fundamental frequency. As an example, a crystal with a fundamental frequency of 
1 MHz has a fi  rst overtone of approximately 2 MHz, a second overtone of approx-
imately 3 MHz, and so on.
The formula for the fundamental frequency of a crystal is:
f 5   K __ t   (21-19)
where K is a constant and t is the thickness of the crystal. Since the fundamental 
frequency is inversely proportional to the thickness, there is a limit to the highest 
fundamental frequency. The thinner the crystal, the more fragile it becomes and 
the more likely it is to break when vibrating.
Quartz crystals work well up to 10 MHz on the fundamental frequency. 
To reach higher frequencies, we can use a crystal that vibrates on overtones. 
In this way, we can reach frequencies up to 100 MHz. Occasionally, the more 
 expensive but stronger tourmaline is used at higher frequencies.
AC-Equivalent Circuit
What does the crystal look like to an ac source? When the crystal of Fig. 21-26 a
is not vibrating, it is equivalent to a capacitance Cm because it has two metal 
plates separated by a dielectric. The capacitance Cm is known as the mounting 
capacitance.
When a crystal is vibrating, it acts like a tuned circuit. Figure 21-26 b
shows the ac-equivalent circuit of a crystal vibrating at its fundamental frequency. 
Typical values are L in henrys, Cs in fractions of a picofarad, R in hundreds 
of ohms, and Cm in picofarads. For instance, a crystal can have values such as 
L 5 3 H, Cs 5 0.05 pF, R 5 2 kV, and Cm 5 10 pF.
Crystals have an incredibly high Q. For the values just given, Q is 
almost 4000. The Q of a crystal can easily be over 10,000. The extremely high Q of (a)( b) (c)AC

derstand why this is true when we examine Eq. (21-9), the exact equation for 
resonant frequency:
fr 5   1 _______ 2/H9266  Ï— LC      Ï—
   Q2 ______ Q2 1 1    
When Q approaches infi  nity, the resonant frequency approaches the ideal value 
determined by the values of L and C, which are precise in a crystal. By compari-
son, the L and C values of a Colpitts oscillator have large tolerances, which means 
that the frequency is less precise.
Series and Parallel Resonance
The series resonant frequency f s of a crystal is the resonant frequency of the LCR 
branch in Fig. 21-26 b. At this frequency, the branch current  reaches a maximum 
value because L resonates with Cs. The formula for this resonant frequency is: 
fs 5   1 ________ 2p  Ï— LCs     (21-20)
The parallel resonant frequency f p of the crystal is the frequency at 
which the circulating or loop current of Fig. 21-26 b reaches a maximum value. 
Since this loop current must fl  ow through the series combination of Cs and Cm, the 
equivalent parallel capacitance is:
Cp 5   CmCs ________ Cm 1 Cs   (21-21)
and the parallel resonant frequency is:
fp 5   1 ________  2p  Ï— LCp     (21-22)
 In any crystal, Cs is much smaller than Cm. Because of this, fp is only 
slightly greater than fs. When we use a crystal in an ac-equivalent circuit like 
Fig. 21-27, the additional circuit capacitances appear in shunt with Cm. Because 
of this, the oscillation frequency will lie between fs and fp.
Crystal Stability
The frequency of any oscillator tends to change slightly with time. This drift is 
produced by temperature, aging, and other causes. In a crystal oscillator, the fre-
quency drift is very small, typically less than 1 part in 106 per day. Stability like 
this is important in electronic wristwatches because they use quartz-crystal oscil-
lators as the basic timing device.
By putting a crystal oscillator in a temperature-controlled oven, we can 
get a frequency drift of less than 1 part in 1010 per day. A clock with this drift will CsL

Crystal Oscillators
Figure 21-28 a shows a Colpitts crystal oscillator. The capacitive voltage divider 
produces the feedback voltage for the base of the transistor. The crystal acts like 
an inductor that resonates with C1 and C2. The oscillation frequency is between 
the series and parallel resonant frequencies of the crystal.

back signal is applied to the emitter instead of the base. This variation allows the

21-7  The 555 Timer
The NE555 (also LM555, CA555, and MC1455) is a widely used IC timer,  a 
circuit that can run in either of two modes: monostable  (one stable state) or 
astable  (no stable states). In the monostable mode, it can produce accurate time 
delays from microseconds to hours. In the astable mode, it can produce rectangu-
lar waves with a variable duty cycle.
Monostable Operation

output voltage at which it can remain indefi  nitely. When the 555 timer receives a

fs 5   1 ________________   2/H9266  Ï——  (3H)(0.05pF)     5 411 kHz

fp 5   1 __________________   2/H9266  Ï——  (3H)(0.0498 pF)     5 412 kHz
As we can see, the series and parallel resonant frequencies of the crystal are very 
close in value. If this crystal is used in an oscillator, the frequency of oscillation 
will be between 411 and 412 kHz.

The output remains high for a while and then returns to the low state after a time 
delay of W. The output will remain in the low state until another trigger arrives.
A multivibrator  is a two-state circuit that has zero, one, or two stable 
output states. When the 555 timer is used in the monostable mode, it is sometimes 
called a monostable multivibrator  because it has only one stable state. It is stable 
in the low state until it receives a trigger, which causes the output to temporarily 
change to the high state. The high state, however, is not stable because the output 
returns to the low state when the pulse ends.
When operating in the monostable mode, the 555 timer is often referred 
to as a one-shot multivibrator  because it produces only one output pulse for each 
input trigger. The duration of this output pulse can be precisely controlled with an 
external resistor and capacitor.
The 555 timer is an 8-pin IC. Figure 21-29 shows four of the pins. Pin 
1 is connected to ground, and pin 8 is connected to the positive supply voltage. 
The 555 timer will work with any supply voltage between 14.5 and 118 V. The 
trigger goes into pin 2, and the output comes from pin 3. The other pins, which are 
not shown here, are connected to external components that determine the pulse 
width of the output.
Astable Operation
The 555 timer can also be connected to run as an astable multivibrator.  When used 
in this way, the 555 timer has no stable states, which means that it cannot  remain 
indefi  nitely in either state. Stated another way, it oscillates when operated in the 
astable mode and it produces a rectangular output signal.
Figure 21-30 shows the 555 timer used in the astable mode. As we can 
see, the output is a series of rectangular pulses. Since no input trigger is needed 
to get an output, the 555 timer operating in the astable mode is sometimes called 
a free-running multivibrator.
Functional Block Diagram
The schematic diagram of a 555 timer is complicated because it has about 
two dozen components connected as diodes, current mirrors, and transistors. 
Figure 21-31 shows a functional diagram of the 555 timer. This diagram cap-
tures all the key ideas we need for our discussion of the 555 timer.
As shown in Fig. 21-31, the 555 timer contains a voltage divider, two 
comparators, an RS fl ip-fl op, and an npn transistor. Since the voltage divider has 
equal resistors, the top comparator has a trip point of:
UTP  5   2VCC _____ 3   (21-23)
The lower comparator has a trip point of:
LTP 5   VCC ____ 3   (21-24)

0Figure 21-30   The 555 timer used in astable (free-running) mode.Oscillators 927In Fig. 21-31, pin 6 is connected to the upper comparator. The voltage on 
pin 6 is called the threshold.  This voltage comes from external components not 
shown. When the threshold voltage  is greater than the UTP, the upper comparator 
has a high output.
Pin 2 is connected to the lower comparator. The voltage on pin 2 is called 
the trigger.  This is the trigger voltage that is used for the monostable operation of 
the 555 timer. When the timer is inactive, the trigger voltage is high. When the trig-
ger voltage falls to less than the LTP, the lower comparator produces a high output.
Pin 4 may be used to reset the output voltage to zero. Pin 5 may be used 
to control the output frequency when the 555 timer is used in the astable mode. In 
many applications, these two pins are made inactive as follows: Pin 4 is connected 
to 1VCC, and pin 5 is bypassed to ground through a capacitor. Later, we will dis-
cuss how pins 4 and 5 are used in some advanced circuits.
RS Flip-Flop
Before we can understand how a 555 timer works with external components, we 
need to discuss the action of the block that contains S, R, Q, and Qw. This block is 
called an RS fl ip-fl  op,  a circuit that has two stable states.
Figure 21-32 shows one way to build an RS fl ip-fl op. In a circuit like 
this, one of the transistors is saturated, and the other is cut off. For instance, if 
the right transistor is saturated, its collector voltage will be approximately zero. 
This means that there is no base current in the left transistor. As a result, the left 
transistor is cut off, producing a high collector voltage. This high collector voltage 
produces a large base current that keeps the right transistor in saturation.+

R QFigure 21-31   Simpliﬁ  ed functional block diagram of a 555 timer.928 Chapter 21The RS fl ip-fl op has two outputs, Q and Qw. These are two-state outputs, 
either low or high voltages. Furthermore, the two outputs are always in opposite 
states. When Q is low, Qw is high. When Q is high, Qw is low. For this reason, Qw 
is called the complement of Q.  The overbar on Qw is used to indicate that it is the 
complement of Q.
We can control the output states with the S and R inputs. If we apply a 
large positive voltage to the S input, we can drive the left transistor into saturation. 
This will cut off the right transistor. In this case, Q will be high and Qw will be low. 
The high S input can then be removed because the saturated left transistor will 
keep the right transistor in cutoff.
Similarly, we can apply a large positive voltage to the R input. This will 
saturate the right transistor and cut off the left transistor. For this condition, Q 
is low and Q Qw is high. After this transition has occurred, the high R input can be 
removed because it is no longer needed.
Since the circuit is stable in either of two states, it is sometimes called a 
bistable multivibrator.  A bistable multivibrator latches in either of two states. 
A high S input forces Q into the high state, and a high R input forces Q to return 
to the low state. The output Q remains in a given state until it is triggered into the 
 opposite s tate.
Incidentally, the S input is sometimes called the set input  because it sets 
the Q output to high. The R input is called the reset input  because it resets the Q 
output to low.
Monostable Operation
Figure 21-33 shows the 555 timer connected for monostable operation. The cir-
cuit has an external resistor R and a capacitor C. The voltage across the capacitor 
is used for the threshold voltage to pin 6. When the trigger arrives at pin 2, the 
circuit produces a rectangular output pulse from pin 3.
Here is the theory of operation. Initially, the Q output of the RS fl ip-fl  op 
is high. This saturates the transistor and clamps the capacitor voltage at ground. 
The circuit will remain in this state until a trigger arrives. Because of the voltage 
divider, the trip points are the same as previously discussed: UTP 5 2VCC/3 and 
LTP 5 VCC/3.
When the trigger input falls to slightly less than VCC/3, the lower com-
parator resets the fl  ip-fl  op. Since Q has changed to low, the transistor goes into 
cutoff, allowing the capacitor to charge. At this time, Qw has changed to high. RS
SRRC
Q Q—RC+VCC
RRRB RBFigure 21-32 RS ﬂ  ip-ﬂ  op built with transistors.Oscillators 929The capacitor now charges exponentially as shown. When the capacitor voltage 
is slightly greater than 2 VCC/3, the upper comparator sets the fl  ip-fl op. The high 
Q turns on the transistor, which discharges the capacitor almost instantly. At the 
same instant, Qw returns to the low state and the output pulse ends. Qw remains low 
until another input trigger arrives.
The complementary output Qw comes out of pin 3. The width of the rec-
tangular pulse depends on how long it takes to charge the capacitor through resist-
ance R. The longer the time constant, the longer it takes for the capacitor voltage 
to reach 2 VCC/3. In one time constant, the capacitor can charge to 63.2 percent of 
VCC. Since 2 VCC/3 is equivalent to 66.7 percent of VCC, it takes slightly more than 
one time constant for the capacitor voltage to reach 2 VCC/3. By solving the expo-
nential charging equation, it is possible to derive this formula for the pulse width:
W 5 1.1RC (21-25)
Figure 21-34 shows the schematic diagram for the monostable 555 
 circuit as it usually appears. Only the pins and external components are shown. 
Notice that pin 4 (reset) is connected to 1VCC. As discussed earlier, this prevents 
pin 4 from having any effect on the circuit. In some applications, pin 4 may be 
temporarily grounded to suspend the operation. When pin 4 is taken high, the 
 operation resumes. A later discussion will describe this type of reset in more 
 detail.+

which changes the width of the pulse. Later, we will discuss pulse-width modula-
tion, in which an external voltage is applied to pin 5 to change the pulse width. For 
now, we will bypass pin 5 to ground as shown. By ac-grounding pin 5, we prevent 
stray electromagnetic noise from interfering with the operation of the 555 timer. 
In summary, the monostable 555 timer produces a single pulse whose 
width is determined by the external R and C used in Fig. 21-34. The pulse begins 
with the leading edge of the input trigger. A one-shot operation like this has a 
number of applications in digital and switching circuits.+VCC

Example 21-6 
In Fig. 21-34, VCC 5 12 V, R 5 33 k V, and C 5 0.47 /H9262F. What is the minimum 
trigger voltage that produces an output pulse? What is the maximum capacitor 
voltage? What is the width of the output pulse?
SOLUTION   As shown in Fig. 21-33, the lower comparator has a trip point 
of LTP. Therefore, the input trigger on pin 2 has to fall from 1VCC to slightly less 
than LTP. With the equations shown in Fig. 21-34:
LTP 5   12 V _____ 3   5 4 V
After a trigger arrives, the capacitor charges from 0 V to a maximum of UTP, 
which is:
UTP 5   2(12 V) _______  3   5 8 V
The pulse width of the one-shot output is:
W 5 1.1(33 k V)(0.47 /H9262F) 5 17.1 ms
This means that the falling edge of the output pulse occurs 17.1 ms after the 
 trigger arrives. You can think of this 17.1 ms as a time delay because the falling 
edge of the output pulse can be used to trigger some other circuit.

change R to 100 k V, and repeat Example 21-6.Oscillators 93121-8   Astable Operation of 
the 555 Timer
Generating time delays from microseconds to hours is useful in many applica-
tions. The 555 timer can also be used as an astable or free-running multivibrator. 
In this mode, it requires two external resistors and one capacitor to set the fre-
quency of oscillations.
Astable Operation
Figure 21-35 shows the 555 timer connected for astable operation. The trip points 
are the same as for monostable operation:
UTP 5   2VCC _____ 3  
LTP 5   VCC ____ 3  
When Q is low, the transistor is cut off and the capacitor is charging through a 
total resistance of:
R 5 R1 1 R2
Because of this, the charging time constant is ( R1 1 R2)C. As the capacitor 
charges, the threshold voltage (pin 6) increases.
Eventually, the threshold voltage exceeds 12VCC/3. Then, the upper 
comparator sets the fl  ip-fl  op. With Q high, the transistor saturates and grounds 
pin 7. The capacitor now discharges through R2. Therefore, the discharging time 
constant is R2C. When the capacitor voltage drops to slightly less than VCC/3, the 
lower comparator resets the fl  ip-fl  op.
Figure 21-36 shows the waveforms. The timing capacitor has exponen-
tially rising and falling voltages between UTP and LTP. The output is a rectan-
gular wave that swings between 0 and VCC. Since the charging time constant is 
longer than the discharging time constant, the output is nonsymmetrical. Depend-
ing on resistances R1 and R2, the duty cycle is between 50 and 100 percent.
By analyzing the equations for charging and discharging, we can derive 
the following formulas. The pulse width is given by:
W 5 0.693( R1 1 R2)C (21-26)
Example 21-7
What is the pulse width in Fig. 21-34 if R 5 10 M V and C 5 470 /H9262F?
SOLUTION   
W 5 1.1(10 M V)(470 /H9262F) 5 5170 s 5 86.2 min 5 1.44 hr
Here we have a pulse width of more than an hour. The falling edge of the pulse 
occurs after a time delay of 1.44 hr.932 Chapter 21The period of the output equals:
T 5 0.693( R1 1 2R2)C (21-27)

When R1 is much smaller than R2, the duty cycle approaches 50 percent. Con-
versely, when R1 is much greater than R2, the duty cycle approaches 100 percent.
Figure 21-37 shows the astable 555 timer as it usually appears on a sche-
matic diagram. Again notice how pin 4 (reset) is tied to the supply voltage and 
how pin 5 (control) is bypassed to ground through a 0.01- /H9262F capacitor.
The circuit of Fig. 21-37 can be modifi  ed to enable the duty cycle to 
 become less than 50 percent. By placing a diode in parallel with R2 (anode con-
nected to pin 7), the capacitor will effectively charge through R1 and the diode. 
The capacitor will discharge through R2. Therefore, the duty cycle becomes:
D 5   R1 _______ R1 1R2   (21-30)
VCO Operation
Figure 21-38 a shows a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO),  another application 
for a 555 timer. The circuit is sometimes called a voltage-to-frequency converter
because an input voltage can change the output frequency.
Here is how the circuit works: Recall that pin 5 connects to the inverting 
input of the upper comparator (Fig. 21-31). Normally, pin 5 is bypassed to ground 
through a capacitor, so that UTP equals 12VCC/3. In Fig. 21-38 a, however, the 
voltage from a stiff potentiometer overrides the internal voltage. In other words, 
UTP equals Vcon. By adjusting the potentiometer, we can change UTP to a value 
between 0 and VCC.
Figure 21-38 b shows the voltage waveform across the timing capacitor. 
Notice that the waveform has a minimum value of 1Vcon/2 and a maximum value 
of 1Vcon. If we increase Vcon, it takes the capacitor longer to charge and discharge. 
Therefore, the frequency decreases. As a result, we can change the frequency of 
the circuit by varying the control voltage. Incidentally, the control voltage may 
come from a potentiometer, as shown, or it may be the output of a transistor cir-
cuit, an op amp, or some other device.
By analyzing the exponential charging and discharging of the capacitor, 
we can derive these equations:

The output stage of a 555 timer can source  200 mA. This means that a high output 
can produce up to 200 mA of load current (sourcing). Because of this, the 555 
timer can drive relatively heavy loads such as relays, lamps, and loudspeakers. 
The output stage of a 555 timer can also sink 200 mA. This means that a low out-
put can allow up to 200 mA to fl  ow to ground (sinking). For instance, when a 555 
timer drives a TTL load, the timer sources current when the output is high and it 
sinks current when the output is low. In this section, we discuss some applications 
for a 555 timer.
Start and Reset
Figure 21-39 shows a circuit with a number of modifi  cations from the monosta-
ble timer shown earlier. To begin with, the trigger input (pin 2) is controlled by a 
Example 21-9
The VCO of Fig. 21-38 a has the same R1, R2, and C as in Example 21-8. What are 
the frequency and duty cycle when Vcon is 11 V? What are the frequency and duty 
cycle when Vcon is 1 V?
SOLUTION   Using the equations of Fig. 21-38:
W 5 2(75 k V 1 30 k V)(47 nF) ln   12 V 2 11 V  ____________   12 V 2 5.5 V   5 9.24 ms

The frequency is:
f 5   1 __ T   5   1 — 10.2 ms   5 98 Hz
When Vcon is 1 V, the calculations give:

PRACTICE PROBLEM 21-9   Repeat Example 21-9 with VCC 5 15 V and 
Vcon 5 10 V .936 Chapter 21push-button switch (START). Since the switch is normally open, pin 2 is high and 
the circuit is inactive.
When somebody pushes and releases the START switch, pin 2 is tempo-
rarily pulled down to ground. Therefore, the output goes high and the LED turns 
on. Capacitor C1 charges positively, as previously described. The charging time 
constant can be varied with R1. In this way, we can get time delays of seconds 
to hours. When the capacitor voltage is slightly greater than 2 VCC/3, the circuit 
resets and the output goes low. When this happens, the LED turns off.
Notice the RESET switch. It can be used to reset the circuit at any time 
during the output pulse. Since the switch is normally open, pin 4 is high and has 
no effect on the operation of the timer. When the RESET switch is closed, how-
ever, pin 4 is pulled down to ground and the output is reset to zero. The RESET 
is included because the user may want to terminate the high output. For instance, 
if the output pulse width has been set to 5 min, the user can terminate the pulse 
prematurely by pushing the RESET.
Incidentally, the output signal vout can be used to drive a relay, a power 
FET, an IGBT, a buzzer, and so on. The LED serves as an indicator of the high 
output being delivered to some other circuit.
Sirens and Alarms
Figure 21-40 shows how to use an astable 555 timer as a siren or an alarm. Nor-
mally, the ALARM switch is closed, which pulls pin 4 down to ground. In this 
case, the 555 timer is inactive and there is no output. When the ALARM switch is 
opened, however, the circuit will generate a rectangular output whose frequency 
is determined by R1, R2, and C1.
The output from pin 3 drives a loudspeaker through a resistance of R4. 
The size of this resistance depends on the supply voltage and the impedance of the 
loudspeaker. The impedance of the branch with R4 and the speaker should limit 
the output current to 200 mA or less because this is the maximum current a 555 
timer can source.START555+VCC

for the speaker. For instance, we can use the output from pin 3 to drive a Class-B 
push-pull power amplifi  er, the output of which then drives the speaker.
Pulse-Width Modulator
Figure 21-41 shows a circuit used for pulse-width modulation (PWM).  The 555 
timer is connected in the monostable mode. The values of R, C, UTP, and VCC
 determine the width of the output pulse as follows:
W 5 2RC ln  ( 1 2   UTP _____ VCC   )  (21-34)
A low-frequency signal called a modulating signal  is capacitively cou-
pled into pin 5. This modulating signal is voice or computer data. Since pin 5 
controls the value of UTP, vmod is being added to the quiescent UTP. Therefore, 
the instantaneous UTP is given by:
UTP 5   2VCC — 3   1 vmod (21-35)
For instance, if VCC 5 12 V and the modulating signal has a peak value 
of 1 V, then Eq. (21-31) gives:
UTP max 5 8 V 1 1 V 5 9 V
UTP min 5 8 V 2 1 V 5 7 V
This means that the instantaneous UTP varies sinusoidally between 7 and 9 V .
A train of triggers called the clock  is the input to pin 2. Each trigger 
 produces an output pulse. Since the period of the triggers is T, the output will be 
a series of rectangular pulses with a period of T. The modulating signal has no 
 effect on the period T, but it does change the width of each output pulse. At point 
A, the positive peak of the modulating signal, the output pulse is wide as shown. 
At point B, the negative peak of the modulating signal, the output pulse is narrow.555+VCC

SPEAKERFigure 21-40   Astable 555 circuit used for siren or alarm.938 Chapter 21PWM is used in communication systems. It allows a low-frequency mod-
ulating signal (voice or data) to change the pulse width of a high-frequency signal 
called the carrier.  The modulated carrier can be transmitted over copper wire, over 
fi ber-optic cable, or through space to a receiver. The receiver recovers the modu-
lating signal to drive a speaker (voice) or a computer (data).
Pulse-Position Modulation
With PWM, the pulse width changes, but the period is constant because it is de-
termined by the frequency of the input triggers. Because the period is fi  xed, the 
position of each pulse is the same, which means that the leading edge of the pulse 
always occurs after a fi  xed interval of time.
Pulse-position modulation (PPM)  is different. With this type of mod-
ulation, the position (leading edge) of each pulse changes. With PPM, both the 
width and the period of pulses vary with the modulating signal.
Figure 21-42 a shows a pulse-position modulator.  It is similar to the 
VCO discussed earlier. Since the modulating signal is coupled into pin 5, the 
instantaneous UTP is given by Eq. (21-35):
UTP 5   2VCC _____ 3   1 vmod
When the modulating signal increases, UTP increases and the pulse width in-
creases. When the modulating signal decreases, UTP decreases and the pulse 
width decreases. This is why the pulse width varies as shown in Fig. 21-42 b.
The pulse width and period equations are:
W 5 2(R1 1 R2)C ln   VCC 2 UTP  ______________   VCC 2 0.5 UTP   (21-36)
T 5 W 1 0.693 R2C (21-37)
In Eq. (21-37), the second term is the space  between pulses:
Space  5 0.693 R2C (21-38)
This space is the time between the trailing edge of one pulse and the leading edge 
of the next pulse. Since Vcon does not appear in Eq. (21-38), the space between 
pulses is constant, as shown in Fig. 21-42 b.
Since the space is constant, the position of the leading edge of any pulse 
depends on how wide the preceding pulse is. This is why this type of modulation 
is called pulse-position modulation.  Like PWM, PPM is used in communication 
systems to transfer voice or data.
Ramp Generation
Charging a capacitor through a resistor produces an exponential waveform. If we 
use a constant current source instead of a resistor to charge a capacitor, the capac-
itor voltage is a ramp. This is the idea behind the circuit of Fig. 21-43 a. Here we 
have replaced the resistor of a monostable circuit with a pnp current source that 
produces a constant charging current of:
IC 5   VCC 2 VE _________  RE   (21-39)
When a trigger starts the monostable 555 timer of Fig. 21-43 a, the pnp 
current source forces a constant charging current into the capacitor. Therefore, 
the voltage across the capacitor is a ramp, as shown in Fig. 21-43 b. The slope S 
of the ramp is given by:
S 5   IC __ C   (21-40)Oscillators 939

A pulse-width modulator like Fig. 21-41 has VCC 5 12 V, R 5 9.1 k V, and C 5 0.01 /H9262F. The clock has a frequency of 
2.5 kHz. If a modulating signal has a peak value of 2 V, what is the period of the output pulses? What is the quiescent pulse 
width? What are the minimum and maximum pulse widths? What are the minimum and maximum duty cycles?
SOLUTION   The period of the output pulses equals the period of the clock:

A phase-locked loop (PLL)  contains a phase detector, a dc amplifi  er, a low-pass 
fi lter, and a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). When a PLL has an input signal 
with a frequency of fin, its VCO will produce an output frequency that equals fin. 
Phase Detector
Figure 21-44 a shows a phase detector,  the fi  rst stage in a PLL. This circuit pro-
duces an output voltage proportional to the phase difference between two input 
signals. For instance, Fig. 21-44 b shows two input signals with a phase difference 
of D/H9278. The phase detector responds to this phase difference by producing a dc 
output voltage, which is proportional to D/H9278, as shown in Fig. 21-44 c.
When v1 leads v2, as shown in Fig. 21-44 b, D/H9278 is positive. If v1 were to 
lag v2, D/H9278 would be negative. The typical phase detector produces a linear response 
 between 290° and 190°, as shown in Fig. 21-44 c. As we can see, the output of the 
phase detector is zero when D/H9278 5 0°. When D/H9278 is between 0° and 90°, the output 
is a positive voltage. When D/H9278 is between 0° and 290°, the output is a negative 
voltage. The key idea here is that the phase detector produces an output voltage that 
is directly proportional to the phase difference between its two input signals.
The VCO
In Fig. 21-45 a, the input voltage vin to the VCO determines the output frequency 
fout. A typical VCO can be varied over a 10:1 range of frequency. Furthermore, the 
variation is linear as shown in Fig. 21-45 b. When the input voltage to the VCO is 
zero, the VCO is free-running at a quiescent frequency f0. When the input voltage 
is positive, the VCO frequency is greater than f0. If the input voltage is negative, 
the VCO frequency is less than f0.
Block Diagram of a PLL
Figure 21-46 is a block diagram of a PLL. The phase detector produces a dc volt-
age that is proportional to the phase difference of its two input signals. The output 
voltage of the phase detector is usually small. This is why the second stage is a Figure 21-44   (a) Phase detector

Example 21-12.Oscillators 943dc amplifi  er. The amplifi  ed phase difference is fi  ltered before being applied to the 
VCO. Notice that the VCO output is being fed back to the phase detector.
Input Frequency Equals Free-Running 
Frequency
To understand PLL action, let us start with the case of input frequency equal to 
f0, the free-running frequency of the VCO. In this case, the two input signals to 
the phase detector have the same frequency and phase. Because of this, the phase 
difference D/H9278 is 0° and the output of the phase detector is zero. As a result, the 
input voltage to the VCO is zero, which means that the VCO is free-running with 
a frequency of f0. As long as the frequency and phase of the input signal remain 
the same, the input voltage to the VCO will be zero.
Input Frequency Diff  ers from Free-Running 
Frequency
Let us assume that the input and free-running VCO frequencies are each 10 kHz. 
Now, suppose the input frequency increases to 11 kHz. This increase will appear 
to be an increase in phase because v1 leads v2 at the end of the fi  rst cycle, as shown 
in Fig. 21-47 a. Since input signal leads the VCO signal, D/H9278 is positive. In this 
case, the phase detector of Fig. 21-46 produces a positive output voltage. After 
being amplifi  ed and fi  ltered, this positive voltage increases the VCO frequency.
The VCO frequency will increase until it equals 11 kHz, the frequency 
of the input signal. When the VCO frequency equals the input frequency, the 
VCO is locked on  to the input signal. Even though each of the two input signals to 
the phase detector has a frequency of 11 kHz, the signals have a different phase, as 
shown in Fig. 21-47 b. This positive phase difference produces the voltage needed 
to keep the VCO frequency slightly above its free-running frequency.vinfout

The transfer function or con-
version gain K of a VCO can 
be expressed as the amount of 
frequency deviation Df per unit 
change, or DV in dc input volt-
age. Expressed mathematically, 
K 5 /H9004f/DV, where K is the input/
output transfer function speci-
fied in hertz per volt.944 Chapter 21If the input frequency increases further, the VCO frequency also in-
creases as needed to maintain the lock. For instance, if the input frequency in-
creases to 12 kHz, the VCO frequency increases to 12 kHz. The phase difference 
between the two input signals will increase as needed to produce the correct con-
trol voltage for the VCO.
Lock Range
The lock range  of a PLL is the range of input frequencies over which the VCO 
can remain locked on to the input frequency. It is related to the maximum phase 
difference that can be detected. In our discussion, we are assuming that the phase 
detector can produce an output voltage for D/H9278 between 290° and 190°. At these 
limits, the phase detector produces a maximum output voltage, either negative or 
positive.
If the input frequency is too low or too high, the phase difference is out-
side the range of 290° and 190°. Therefore, the phase detector cannot produce 
the additional voltage needed for the VCO to remain locked on. At these limits, 
therefore, the PLL loses its lock on the input signal.
The lock range is usually specifi  ed as a percentage of the VCO  frequency. 
For instance, if the VCO frequency is 10 kHz and the lock range is 620 percent, 
the PLL can remain locked on any input frequency between 8 and 12 kHz.
Capture Range
The capture range is different. Assume that the input frequency is outside the lock 
range. Then, the VCO is free-running at 10 kHz. Now, assume that the input fre-
quency changes toward the VCO frequency. At some point, the PLL will be able 
to lock on to the input frequency. The range of input frequencies within which the 
PLL can reestablish the lock is called the capture range.
The capture range is specifi  ed as a percentage of the free-running fre-
quency. If f0 5 10 kHz and the capture range is 65 percent, the PLL can lock 
on to an input frequency between 9.5 and 10.5 kHz. Typically, the capture range 
is less than the lock range because the capture range depends on the cutoff fre-
quency of the low-pass fi  lter. The lower the cutoff frequency, the smaller the 
capture range. 
The cutoff frequency of the low-pass fi  lter is kept low to prevent high-
frequency components like noise or other unwanted signals from reaching the 
VCO. The lower the cutoff frequency of the fi  lter, the cleaner the signal driving 
the VCO. Therefore, a designer has to trade off capture range against low-pass 
bandwidth to get a clean signal for the VCO.
Applications
A PLL can be used in two fundamentally different ways. First, it can be used to 
lock on to the input signal. The output frequency then equals the input frequency. 
This has the advantage of cleaning up a noisy input signal because the low-pass 
fi lter will remove high-frequency noise and other components. Since the output 
signal comes from the VCO, the fi  nal output is stable and almost noise-free.
Second, a PLL can be used as an FM demodulator. The theory of fre-
quency modulation (FM)  is covered in communication courses, so we will dis-
cuss only the basic idea. The LC oscillator of Fig. 21-48 a has a variable capaci-
tance. If a modulating signal controls this capacitance, the oscillator output will be 
frequency-modulated,  as shown in Fig. 21-48 b. Notice how the frequency of Oscillators 945this FM wave varies from a minimum to a maximum, corresponding to the 
minimum and maximum peaks of the modulating signal.
If the FM signal is the input to a PLL, the VCO frequency will lock on to 
the FM signal. Since the VCO frequency varies, D/H9278 follows the variations in the 
modulating signal. Therefore, the output of the phase detector will be a low-fre-
quency signal that is a replica of the original modulating signal. When used in 
this way, the PLL is being used as an FM demodulator,  a circuit that recovers the 
modulating signal from the FM wave.
PLLs are available as monolithic ICs. For instance, the NE565 is a PLL 
that contains a phase detector, a VCO, and a dc amplifi  er. The user connects 
external components like a timing resistor and capacitor to set the free-running 
frequency of the VCO. Another external capacitor sets the cutoff frequency of the 
low-pass fi  lter. The NE565 can be used for FM demodulation, frequency synthe-
sis, telemetry receivers, modems, tone decoding, and so forth.
21-11  Function Generator ICs
Special function-generator ICs have been developed that combine many of the 
individual circuit capabilities we have been discussing. These ICs are able to pro-
vide waveform generation, including sine, square, triangle, ramp, and pulse sig-
nals. The output waveforms can be made to vary in amplitude and frequency by 
changing the values of external resistors and capacitors or by applying an external 
voltage. This external voltage enables the IC to perform useful applications such 
as voltage-to-frequency (V/F) conversion, AM and FM signal generation, volt-
age-controlled oscillation (VCO), and frequency-shift keying (FSK).
The XR-2206
An example of a special function generator IC is the XR-2206. This monolithic 
IC can provide externally controlled frequencies from 0.01 Hz to more than 
1 MHz. A block diagram of this IC is shown in Fig. 21-49. The diagram shows 
four main functional blocks, which include a VCO, an analog multiplier and sine-
shaper, a unity gain buffer amplifi  er, and a set of current switches.
The output frequency of the VCO is proportional to an input current, 
which is determined by a set of external timing resistors. These resistors connect 
to pins 7 and 8, respectively, and ground. Because there are two timing pins, two 
discrete output frequencies can be obtained. A high or low input signal on pin 9 
controls the current switches. The current switches then select which one of the 
timing resistors will be used. If the input signal on pin 9 alternately changes from 
high to low, the output frequency of the VCO will be shifted from one frequency 
to another. This action is referred to as frequency-shift keying (FSK)  and is used 
in electronic communication applications.
The output of the VCO drives the multiplier and sine-shaper block, along 
with an output switching transistor. The output switching transistor is driven to LC

oscillator; ( b) sine wave has been frequency-modulated.946 Chapter 21cutoff and saturation, which provides a square wave output signal at pin 11. The 
output of the multiplier and sine-shaper block is connected to a unity gain buffer 
amplifi  er, which determines the IC’s output current capability and its output 
 impedance. The output at pin 2 can be either a sine wave or a triangle wave.
Sine- and Triangle-Wave Output
Figure 21-50 a shows the external circuit connections and components for generat-
ing sine waves or triangle waves. The frequency of oscillation f0 is determined by 
the timing resistor R, connected at either pin 7 or pin 8, and the external capacitor 
C, connected across pins 5 and 6. The value of oscillation is found by:
f0 5   1 ___ RC   (21-31)
Even though R can be up to 2 M V, maximum temperature stability 
 occurs when 4 k V , R , 200 k V. A graph of R versus oscillation frequency is 
shown in Fig. 21-50 b. Also, the recommended value of C should be from 1000 
pF to 100 μF.
In Fig. 21-50 a, when the switch S1 is closed, the output at pin 2 will be 
a sine wave. The potentiometer R1 at pin 7 provides the desired frequency tuning. 
Adjustable resistors RA and RB enable the output waveform to be modifi  ed for 
proper waveform symmetry and distortion levels. When S1 is open, the output at 
pin 2 changes from a sine wave to a triangle wave. Resistor R3, connected at pin 
3, controls the amplitude of the output waveform. As shown in Fig. 21-50 c, the 
output amplitude is directly proportional to the value of R3. Notice that the value 
of the triangle waveform is approximately double the output of a sine waveform 
for a given R3 setting.VCC

Figure 21-51 shows the external connections of the circuit used to create sawtooth 
(ramp) and pulse outputs. Notice that the square wave output at pin 11 is shorted 
to the FSK terminal at pin 9. This allows the circuit to automatically frequency-
shift between two separate frequencies. This frequency shift occurs when the 
output at pin 11 changes from a high-level output to a low-level output or from a 
low-level output to a high-level output. The output frequency is found by:

and the circuit’s duty cycle is found by:

Figure 21-52 shows a data sheet for the XR-2206. If operated with a 
single positive supply voltage, the supply can range from 10 to 26 V. If a split- or 
dual-supply voltage is used, notice how the values range from 65 to 613 V. 
Figure 21-52 also shows recommended R and C values for generating maximum 
and minimum output frequencies. Also specifi  ed is the typical sweep range of 
2000:1. As shown in the data sheet, the triangle- and sine-wave output has an 
output impedance value of 600 V. This makes the XR-2206 function generator IC

Summary
SEC. 21-1   THEORY OF 
SINUSOIDAL 
OSCILLATION
To build a sinusoidal oscillator, we 
need to use an ampliﬁ  er with positive 
feedback. For the oscillator to start, 
the loop gain must be greater than 
1 when the phase shift around the 
loop is 0°.
SEC. 21-2   THE WIEN-BRIDGE 
OSCILLATOR
This is the standard oscillator for low 
to moderate frequencies in the range 
of 5 Hz to 1 MHz. It produces an al-
most perfect sine wave. A tungsten 
lamp or other nonlinear resistance is 
used to decrease the loop gain to 1.
SEC. 21-3   OTHER RC 
OSCILLATORS
The twin-T oscillator uses an ampli-
ﬁ er and RC circuits to produce the 
required loop gain and phase shift at 
the resonant frequency. It works well 
at one frequency but is not suitable 
for an adjustable frequency oscillator. 
The phase-shift oscillator also uses an 
ampliﬁ  er and RC circuits to produce 
oscillations. An ampliﬁ  er can act like a 
phase-shift oscillator because of the 
stray lead and lag circuits in each stage.
SEC. 21-4   THE COLPITTS 
OSCILLATOR
RC oscillators usually do not work 
well above 1 MHz because of the 
additional phase shift inside the am-
pliﬁ  er. This is why LC oscillators are 
preferred for frequencies between 
1 and 500 MHz. This frequency 
range is beyond the funity of most op 
amps, which is why a bipolar junction transistor or FET is commonly used 
for the amplifying device. The Col-
pitts oscillator is one of the most 
widely used LC oscillators.
SEC. 21-5   OTHER LC 
OSCILLATORS
The Armstrong oscillator uses a 
transformer to produce the feedback 
signal. The Hartley oscillator uses an 
inductive voltage divider to produce 
the feedback signal. The Clapp os-
cillator has a small series capacitor in 
the inductive branch of the resonant 
circuit. This reduces the eff  ect that 
stray capacitances have on the 
resonant frequency.
SEC. 21-6  QUARTZ CRYSTALS
Some crystals exhibit the piezoelectric 
eff ect. Because of this eff  ect, a vibrat-
ing crystal acts like an LC resonant 
circuit with an extremely high Q. Quartz 
is the most important crystal produc-
ing the piezoelectric eff  ect. It is used 
in crystal oscillators, in which a precise 
and reliable frequency is needed.
SEC. 21-7  THE 555 TIMER
The 555 timer contains two com-
parators, an RS ﬂ  ip-ﬂ  op, and an npn 
transistor. It has an upper and lower 
trip point. When used in the monosta-
ble mode, the input triggers must fall 
below LTP to start the action. When 
the capacitor voltage slightly ex-
ceeds UTP, the discharge transistor 
turns on to discharge the capacitor.
SEC. 21-8   ASTABLE OPERA-
TION OF THE 555 
TIMER
When used in the astable mode, the 
555 timer produces a rectangular 
output whose duty cycle can be set 
between 50 and 100 percent. The capacitor charges between VCC/3 
and 2 VCC/3. When a control volt-
age is used, it changes UTP to Vcon. 
This control voltage determines the 
frequency.
SEC. 21-9  555 CIRCUIT 
APPLICATIONS
The 555 timer can be used to create 
time delays, alarms, and ramp out-
puts. It can also be used to build a 
pulse-width modulator by applying a 
modulating signal to the control input 
and a train of negative-going triggers 
to the trigger input. The 555 timer an 
also be used to build a pulse-position 
modulator by applying a modulating 
signal to the control input when the 
timer is in the astable mode.
SEC. 21-10   THE PHASE-
LOCKED LOOP
A PLL contains a phase detector, a 
dc ampliﬁ  er, a low-pass ﬁ  lter, and a 
VCO. The phase detector produces 
a control voltage that is proportional 
to the phase diff  erence between its 
two input signals. The ampliﬁ  ed and 
ﬁ  ltered control voltage then changes 
the frequency of the VCO as needed 
to lock on to the input signal.
SEC. 21-11   FUNCTION GENERA-
TOR ICS
Function generator ICs have the abil-
ity to produce sine, square, triangle, 
pulse, and sawtooth waveforms. 
By connecting external resistors and 
capacitors, the output waveforms 
can be made to vary in frequency 
and amplitude. Special functions, 
including AM/FM generation, 
voltage-to-frequency conversion, 
and frequency-shift keying, can also 
be performed by these ICs.952 Chapter 21Self-Test

With a zener diode, we can build simple voltage regulators. 
Now, we want to discuss the use of negative feedback to 
improve voltage regulation. The discussion begins with linear 
regulators, the kind in which the regulating device is operating 
in the linear region. We will discuss two types of linear 
regulators: the shunt type and the series type. This chapter 
concludes with switching regulators, the type in which the 
regulating device switches on and off   to improve the power 
effi  ciency.

The quality of a power supply depends on its load regulation, line regulation, and 
output resistance. In this section, we will look at these characteristics because they 
are often used on data sheets to specify power supplies.
Load Regulation
Figure 22-1 shows a bridge rectifi  er with a capacitor-input fi  lter. Changing the load 
resistance will change the load voltage. If we reduce the load resistance, we get 
more ripple and additional voltage drop across the transformer windings and di-
odes. Because of this, an increase in load current always decreases the load  voltage.
Load regulation  indicates how much the load voltage changes when the 
load current changes. The defi  nition for load regulation is:
Load regulation  5   VNL 2 VFL __________  VFL   3 100% (22-1)
where VNL 5 load voltage with no-load current
VFL 5 load voltage with full-load current
With this defi  nition, VNL occurs when the load current is zero, and VFL occurs 
when the load current is the maximum value for the design.
For instance, suppose that the power supply of Fig. 22-1 has these values:
VNL 5 10.6 V for IL 5 0
VFL 5 9.25 V for IL 5 1 A
Then, Eq. (22-1) gives:
Load regulation 5   10.6 V 2 9.25 V  ______________  9.25 V   3 100% 5 14.6%
The smaller the load regulation, the better the power supply. For  instance, 
a well-regulated power supply can have a load regulation of less than 1 percent.

Load regulation =

Line regulation = × 100%VNL – VFL
VFL
VHL – VLL
VLLFigure 22-1  Power supply with capacitor-input ﬁ  lter.Regulated Power Supplies  961This means that the load voltage varies less than 1 percent over the full range of 
load current.
Line Regulation
In Fig. 22-1, the input line voltage has a nominal value of 120 V . The actual 
voltage coming out of a power outlet may vary from 105 to 125 V rms, depending 
on the time of day, the locality, and other factors. Since the secondary voltage is 
 directly proportional to the line voltage, the load voltage in Fig. 22-1 will change 
when line voltage changes.
Another way to specify the quality of a power supply is by its line 
 regulation,  defi  ned as:
Line regulation  5   VHL 2 VLL __________  VLL   3 100% (22-2)
where VHL 5 load voltage with high line
VLL 5 load voltage with low line
For instance, suppose that the power supply of Fig. 22-1 has these measured values:
VLL 5 9.2 V for line voltage 5 105 V rms
VHL 5 11.2 V for line voltage 5 125 V rms
Then, Eq. (22-2) gives:
Line regulation 5   11.2 V 2 9.2 V  ——  9.2 V   3 100% 5 21.7%
As with load regulation, the smaller the line regulation, the better the 
power supply. For example, a well-regulated power supply can have a line reg-
ulation of less than 0.1 percent. This means that the load voltage varies less than 
0.1 percent when the line voltage varies from 105 to 125 V rms.
Output Resistance
The Thevenin or output resistance of a power supply determines the load regula-
tion. If a power supply has a low output resistance, its load regulation will also be 
low. Here is one way to calculate the output resistance:
RTH 5   VNL 2 VFL __________  IFL   (22-3)
For example, here are the values given earlier for Fig. 22-1:
VNL 5 10.6 V for IL 5 0
VFL 5 9.25 V for IL 5 1 A
For this power supply, the output resistance is:
RTH 5   10.6 V 2 9.25 V  ______________  1 A   5 1.35 V
Figure 22-2 shows a graph of load voltage versus load current. As we 
can see, the load voltage decreases when the load current increases. The change in 
load voltage ( VNL 2 VFL) divided by the change in current ( IFL) equals the output 
resistance of the power supply. The output resistance is related to the slope of this 
graph. The more horizontal the graph, the lower the output resistance.
In Fig. 22-2, the maximum load current IFL occurs when the load resist-
ance is minimum. Because of this, an equivalent expression for load regulation is:
Load regulation  5   RTH ______ RL(min)   3 100% (22-4)GOOD TO KNOW
Equation (22-3) can also be 
shown as:
RTH 5   VNL 2 VFL ________  VFL   3 RL962 Chapter 22For example, if a power supply has an output resistance of 1.5 V and the minimum 
load resistance is 10 V, it has a load regulation of:
Load regulation 5   1.5 V _____ 10 V   3 100% 5 15%
22-2   Shunt Regulators
The line regulation and load regulation of an unregulated power supply are too 
high for most applications. By using a voltage regulator between the power supply 
and the load, we can signifi  cantly improve the line and load regulation. A linear 
voltage regulator uses a device operating in the linear region to hold the load 
voltage constant. There are two fundamental types of linear regulators: the shunt 
type and the series type. With the shunt type, the regulating device is in parallel 
with the load.
Zener Regulator
The simplest shunt regulator  is the zener-diode circuit of Fig. 22-3. The zener 
diode operates in the breakdown region, producing an output voltage equal to the 
zener voltage. When the load current changes, the zener current increases or de-
creases to keep the current through RS constant. With any shunt regulator, a change 
in load current is complemented by an opposing change in shunt current. If load 
current increases by 1 mA, the shunt current decreases by 1 mA. Conversely, if the 
load current decreases by 1 mA, the shunt current  increases by 1 mA.RTH =

VoutFigure 22-3  Zener regulator is a shunt regulator.Regulated Power Supplies  963As shown in Fig. 22-3, the equation for the current through the series 
 resistor is:
IS 5   Vin 2 Vout _________  RS  
This series current equals the input current  to the shunt regulator. When the input 
voltage is constant, the input current is almost constant when the load current 
changes. This is how you can recognize any shunt regulator. A change in load 
current has almost no effect on the input current.
A fi  nal point: In Fig. 22-3, the maximum load current with regulation 
 occurs when the zener current is almost zero. Therefore, the maximum load current 
in Fig. 22-3 equals the input current. This is true for any shunt regulator. The max-
imum load current with a regulated output voltage is equal to the input current.
Zener Voltage Plus One Diode Drop
At larger load currents, the load regulation of a zener regulator like Fig. 22-3 gets 
worse (increases) because the changing current through the zener resistance can 
change the output voltage signifi  cantly. One way to improve load regulation at 
larger load currents is to add a transistor to the circuit, as shown in Fig. 22-4. With 
this shunt regulator, the load voltage equals:
Vout 5 VZ 1 VBE (22-5)
Here is how the circuit holds the output voltage constant: If the output 
voltage tries to increase, the increase is coupled through the zener diode to the 
base of the transistor. The larger base voltage produces more collector current 
through RS. The larger voltage drop across RS will offset most of the attempted 
 increase in output voltage. The only noticeable change will be a slight increase in 
load voltage.
Conversely, if the output voltage tries to decrease, the voltage fed back 
to the base reduces the collector current and there is less voltage drop across RS. 
Again, the attempted change in output voltage is offset by an opposing change in 
voltage across the series resistor. This time, the only noticeable change is a slight 
decrease in the output voltage.
Higher Output Voltage
Figure 22-5 shows another shunt regulator. This circuit has the advantage of being 
able to use low-temperature-coeffi  cient zener voltages (between 5 and 6 V). The 
regulated output voltage will have approximately the same temperature coeffi  -
cient as the zener diode, but the voltage will be higher.

VoutFigure 22-4  Improved shunt regulator.GOOD TO KNOW
In Fig. 22-3, it is important to 
remember that Vout changes 
slightly when the zener current 
changes. The change in Vout can 
be determined as DVout5 D IZRZ, 
where RZ represents the zener 
impedance.964 Chapter 22The negative feedback is similar to that of the preceding regulator. Any 
attempted change in output voltage is fed back to the transistor, the output of 
which then almost completely offsets the attempted change in output voltage. 
The result is an output voltage that changes much less than it would without the 
negative feedback.
The base voltage is given by:
VB >   R1 _______ R1 1 R2   Vout
This is an approximation because it does not include the loading effect of the base 
current on the voltage divider. Usually, the base current is small enough to ignore. 
By solving the foregoing equation for output voltage, we get:
Vout >   R1 1 R2 _______  R1   VB
In Fig. 22-5, the base voltage is the sum of the zener voltage plus one VBE drop:
VB 5 VZ 1 VBE
Substituting this into the preceding equation gives:
Vout >   R1 1 R2 _______  R1   (VZ 1 VBE) (22-6)
Figure 22-5 shows the equations for analyzing the circuit. The equation 
for collector current is an approximation because it does not include the current 
through the voltage divider ( R1 and R2). To keep the effi  ciency of the regulator as 
high as possible, a designer normally makes R1 and R2 much larger than the load 
resistance. As a result, the current through the voltage divider is usually small 
enough to neglect in preliminary analysis.
The disadvantage of this regulator is that any changes in VBE will trans-
late into changes in the output voltage. Although useful in simpler applications, 
the circuit of Fig. 22-5 can be improved.
Improved Regulation
One way to reduce the effect of VBE on output voltage is with the shunt regulator 
of Fig. 22-6. The zener diode holds the inverting input of the op amp at a constant 
voltage. The voltage divider consisting of R1 and R2 samples the load voltage and 
returns a feedback voltage to the noninverting input. The output of the op amp 
drives the base of the shunt transistor. Because of the negative feedback, the out-
put voltage is held almost constant in spite of line and load changes.Vout ≅ (VZ + VBE)

VoutR3Figure 22-5  Shunt regulator with higher output.Regulated Power Supplies  965For instance, if the load voltage tries to increase, the feedback signal 
to the noninverting input increases. The output of the op amp drives the base 
harder and increases the collector current. The larger collector current through 
RS  produces a larger voltage across RS, which offsets most of the attempted 
 increase in load voltage. A similar correction occurs when the load voltage tries 
to decrease. In short, any attempted change in output voltage is offset by the neg-
ative  feedback.
In Fig. 22-6, the high voltage gain of the op amp takes VBE out of 
Eq. (22-6), a situation similar to the one with active diode circuits discussed in an 
earlier chapter. Because of this, the load voltage is given by:
Vout 5   R1 1 R2 _______  R1   VZ (22-7)
Short-Circuit Protection
One advantage of shunt regulators is that they have built-in short-circuit protec-
tion. For instance, if we deliberately place a short circuit across the load terminals 
in Fig. 22-6, none of the components in the shunt regulator will be damaged. All 
that happens is the input current increases to:
IS 5   Vin ___ RS  
This current is not large enough to damage any of the components in a typical 
shunt regulator.
Effi  ciency
One way to compare regulators of different designs is by using effi  ciency,   defi ned 
as:
Effi ciency  5   Pout ____ Pin   3 100% (22-8)
where Pout is the load power ( VoutIL) and Pin is the input power ( VinIin). The 
 difference between Pin and Pout is Preg, the power wasted in the regulator 
 components:
Preg 5 Pin 2 Pout
In the shunt regulators of Figs. 22-4 through 22-6, the power dissipation of RS and 
the transistor accounts for most of the power wasted in the regulator.Vout = VZ

In Fig. 22-5, the input current is:

In any well-designed shunt regulator, IS is much greater than I3 to keep the effi  -
ciency high. Therefore, the input power is:

This effi  ciency is low compared to the effi  ciency of other regulators to 
be discussed (series regulators and switching regulators). Low effi  ciency is one 
of the disadvantages of a shunt regulator. Low effi  ciency occurs because of the 
power dissipation in the series resistor and the shunt transistor, which is:

The disadvantage of a shunt regulator is its low effi  ciency, which is caused by 
large power losses in the series resistor and the shunt transistor. When effi  ciency 
is not important, shunt regulators may be used because they have the advantage 
of simplicity.
Better Effi   ciency
When effi  ciency is important, a series regulator or a switching regulator may be 
used. A switching regulator is the most effi  cient of all voltage regulators. It has a 
full-load effi  ciency from about 75 to more than 95 percent. But a switching reg-
ulator is noisy  because it produces radio-frequency interference (RFI),  caused 
by switching a transistor on and off at frequencies from about 10 to more than 100 
kHz. Another disadvantage is that a switching regulator is the most complicated 
regulator to design and build.
On the other hand, the series regulator is quiet  because its transistor 
 always operates in the linear region. Furthermore, a series regulator is relatively 
simple to design and build compared to a switching regulator. Finally, a series

SOLUTION   As discussed earlier, any shunt regulator has a maximum load 
 current approximately equal to the current through RS. Since we have already

applications in which the load power is less than 10 W.
Because of the foregoing reasons, the series regulator has emerged as 
the preferred choice for most applications when the load power is not too high. 
Its relative simplicity, quiet operation, and acceptable transistor power dissipation 
make the series regulator the natural choice for many applications. The remainder 
of this section discusses the series regulator.
The Zener Follower
The simplest series regulator is the zener follower of Fig. 22-7. As discussed in 
an earlier chapter, the zener diode operates in the breakdown region, producing a 
base voltage equal to the zener voltage. The transistor is connected as an emitter 
 follower. Therefore, the load voltage equals:
Vout 5 VZ 2 VBE (22-9)
If the line voltage or load current changes, the zener voltage and base-emitter 
voltage will change only slightly. Because of this, the output voltage shows only 
small changes for large changes in line voltage or load current.
With a series regulator, the load current approximately equals the input 
current because the current through RS is usually small enough to ignore in pre-
liminary analysis. The transistor of a series regulator is called a pass transistor
because all the load current passes through it.
A series regulator is more effi  cient than a shunt regulator because we 
have replaced the series resistor with the pass transistor. Now, the only signifi  cant 
power loss is in the transistor. Higher effi  ciency is one of the main reasons the 
 series regulator is preferred to the shunt regulator when larger load currents are 
needed.
Recall that the shunt regulator has a constant input current when the 
load current changes. The series regulator is different because its input current is 
 approximately equal to the load current. When the load current changes in a series 
regulator, the input current changes by the same amount. This is how you can 
recognize design variations of shunt and series regulators. In shunt regulators, the 
input current is constant when the load current changes, whereas in series regula-
tors, it changes when the load current changes.
Two-Transistor Regulator
Figure 22-8 shows a two-transistor series regulator. If Vout tries to increase be-
cause of an increase in line voltage or an increase in load resistance, more voltage 
is fed back to the base of Q1. This produces a larger Q1 collector current through 
R4 and less base voltage at Q2. The reduced base voltage to the Q2 emitter follower 
almost offsets all the attempted increase in output voltage.
Similarly, if the output voltage tries to decrease because of a decrease in 
line voltage or a decrease in load resistance, there is less feedback voltage at the Vout = VZ – VBE

VoutFigure 22-7  Zener follower is a series regulator.970 Chapter 22base of Q1. This produces more base voltage at Q2, which increases the output 
voltage and almost completely offsets the attempted decrease in output voltage. 
The net effect is only a slight decrease in output voltage.
Output Voltage
The output voltage in Fig. 22-8 is given by:
Vout 5   R1 1 R2 _______  R1   (VZ 1 VBE) (22-10)
With a series regulator like Fig. 22-8, we can use a low zener voltage (5 to 6 V) 
where the temperature coeffi  cient approaches zero. The output voltage has 
 approximately the same temperature coeffi  cient as the zener voltage.
Headroom, Power Dissipation, and Effi   ciency
In Fig. 22-8, the headroom voltage  is defi  ned as the difference between the input 
and output voltage:
Headroom voltage  5 Vin 2 Vout (22-11)
The current through the pass transistor of Fig. 22-8 equals:
IC 5 IL 1 I2
where I2 is the current through R2. To keep the effi  ciency high, a designer will 
make I2 much smaller than the full-load value of IL. Therefore, we can ignore I2 at 
larger load currents and write:
IC > IL
At high load currents, the power dissipation in the pass transistor is given 
by the product of headroom voltage and load current:
PD > (Vin 2 Vout)IL (22-12)
The power dissipation in the pass transistor is very large in some series regulators. 
In this case, a large heat sink is used. Sometimes, a fan is needed to remove the 
excess heat inside enclosed equipment.
At full-load current, most of the regulator power dissipation is in the pass 
transistor. Since the current in the pass transistor is approximately equal to the 
load current, the effi  ciency is given by:

R1Figure 22-8  Discrete series regulator.Regulated Power Supplies  971With this approximation, the best effi  ciency occurs when the output voltage is 
 almost as large as the input voltage. It implies that the smaller the headroom volt-
age, the better the effi  ciency.
To improve the operation of the series regulator, a Darlington connection 
is often used for the pass transistor. This allows us to use a low-power transistor to 
drive a power transistor. The Darlington connection allows us to use larger  values 
of R1 through R4 to improve effi  ciency.
Improved Regulation
Figure 22-9 shows how we can use an op amp to get better regulation. If the out-
put voltage tries to increase, more voltage is fed back to the inverting input. This 
 reduces the output of the op amp, the base voltage of the pass transistor, and the 
 attempted increase in output voltage. If the output voltage tries to decrease, less 
voltage is fed back to the op amp, increasing the base voltage of the pass transistor, 
which almost completely offsets the attempted decrease in output voltage.
The derivation of output voltage is almost the same as for the regulator 
of Fig. 22-8, except that the high voltage gain of the op amp takes VBE out of the 
equation. Because of this, the load voltage is given by:
Vout 5   R1 1 R2 _______  R1   VZ (22-14)
In Fig. 22-9, the op amp is being used as a noninverting amplifi  er with a 
closed-loop voltage gain of:
Av(CL) 5   R2 ___ R1   1 1 (22-15)
The input voltage being amplifi  ed is the zener voltage. This is why you sometimes 
see Eq. (22-14) written as:
Vout 5 Av(CL) VZ (22-16)
For instance, if Av(CL) 5 2 and VZ 5 5.6 V , the output voltage will be 11.2 V .
Current Limiting
Unlike the shunt regulator, the series regulator of Fig. 22-9 has no short-circuit 
protection.  If we accidentally short the load terminals, the load current will try to 
approach infi  nity, which destroys the pass transistor. It may also destroy one or 
more diodes in the unregulated power supply that is driving the series regulator. 
To protect against an accidental short across the load, series regulators usually 
 include some form of current limiting .Vin

R4 is a small resistor called a current-sensing resistor . For our discussion, we 
will use an R4 of 1 V. Since the load current has to pass through R4, the current- 
sensing resistor produces the base-emitter voltage for Q1.
When the load current is less than 600 mA, the voltage across R4 is 
less than 0.6 V. In this case, Q1 is cut off and the regulator works as previously 
 described. When the load current is between 600 and 700 mA, the voltage across 
R4 is between 0.6 and 0.7 V. This turns on Q1. The collector current of Q1 fl ows 
through R5. This decreases the base voltage to Q2, which reduces the load voltage 
and the load current.
When the load is shorted, Q1 conducts heavily and brings the base volt-
age of Q2 down to approximately 1.4 V (two VBE drops above ground). The cur-
rent through the pass transistor is typically limited to 700 mA. It may be slightly 
more or less than this, depending on the characteristics of the two transistors.
Incidentally, resistor R5 is added to the circuit because the output imped-
ance of the op amp is very low (75 V is typical). Without R5, the current-sensing 
transistor does not have enough voltage gain to produce sensitive current limiting. 
A designer will select a value of R5 high enough to produce voltage gain in the 
current-sensing transistor, but not so high that it prevents the op amp from driv ing 
the pass transistor. Typical values of R5 are from a few hundred to a few thousand 
ohms.
Figure 22-11 summarizes the concept of current limiting. As an approx-
imation, the graph shows 0.6 V as the voltage at which current limiting begins 
and 0.7 V as the voltage under shorted-load conditions. When the load current is Vin

the load voltage remains constant up to a VBE of approximately 0.6 V. Beyond this 
point, Q1 turns on and current limiting sets in. Further increases in IL decrease the 
load voltage, and regulation is lost. When the load is shorted, the load current is

discussion. By changing the value of R4, we can get current limiting to begin at 
any level. For instance, if R4 5 10 V, current limiting would start at approxi-
mately 60 mA with a shorted-load current of approximately 70 mA.
Foldback Current Limiting
Current limiting is a big improvement because it will protect the pass transistor 
and rectifi  er diodes in case the load terminals are accidentally shorted. But it has 
the disadvantage of a large power dissipation in the pass transistor when the load 
terminals are shorted. With a short across the load, almost all the input voltage 
 appears across the pass transistor.
To avoid excessive power dissipation in the pass transistor under short-
ed-load conditions, a designer can add foldback current limiting  (Fig. 22-12). 
The voltage across the current-sensing resistor R4 is fed to a voltage divider ( R6
and R7) whose output drives the base of Q1. Over most of the load current range, 
the base voltage of Q1 is less than the emitter voltage, and VBE is negative. This 
keeps Q1 cut off.
When the load current is high enough, however, the base voltage of Q1
becomes higher than the emitter voltage. When VBE is between 0.6 and 0.7 V, cur-
rent limiting starts. Beyond this point, further decreases in load resistance cause 
the current to fold back (decrease). As a result, the shorted-load current is much 
smaller than it would be without the foldback limiting.
Figure 22-13 shows how the output voltage varies with load current. 
The load voltage is constant up to a maximum value of Imax. At this point, current 
limiting starts. When the load resistance decreases further, the current folds back. 
When a short is across the load terminals, the load current equals ISL. The main 
 advantage of foldback current limiting is the reduced power dissipation in the pass 
transistor when the load terminals are accidentally shorted.

If an ordinary transistor with a current gain of 100 were used for the pass transis-
tor, the required base current would be:

This is too much output current for a typical op amp. If a Darlington transistor is 
used, the base current of the pass transistor is reduced to a much lower value. For 
instance, a Darlington transistor with a current gain of 1000 would require a base 
current of only 2.55 mA.

There is a wide variety of linear IC voltage regulators  with pin counts from 
3 to 14. All are series regulators because the series regulator is more effi  cient than 
the shunt regulator. Some IC regulators are used in special applications in which 
 external resistors can set the current limiting, the output voltage, and so on. By 
far, the most widely used IC regulators are those with only three pins: one for the 
 unregulated input voltage, one for the regulated output voltage, and one for ground.
Available in plastic or metal packages, the three-terminal regulators 
have become extremely popular because they are inexpensive and easy to use. 
Aside from two optional bypass capacitors, three-terminal IC voltage regulators 
require no external components.
Basic Types of IC Regulators
Most IC voltage regulators have one of these types of output voltage: fi  xed pos-
itive, fi  xed negative, or adjustable. IC regulators with fi  xed positive or negative 
outputs are factory-trimmed to get different fi  xed voltages with magnitudes from 
about 5 to 24 V . IC regulators with an adjustable output can vary the regulated 
output voltage from less than 2 to more than 40 V .
IC regulators are also classifi  ed as standard, low-power, and low dropout. 
Standard IC regulators are designed for straightforward and noncritical applications. 
With heat sinks, a standard IC regulator can have a load current of more than 1 A.
If load currents up to 100 mA are adequate, low-power IC regulators  are 
available in TO-92 packages, the same size used for small-signal transistors like 
the 2N3904. Since these regulators do not require heat sinking, they are conven-
ient and easy to use.
The dropout voltage  of an IC regulator is defi  ned as the minimum head-
room voltage needed for regulation. For instance, standard IC regulators have a 
dropout voltage of 2 to 3 V. This means that the input voltage has to be at least 2 to 
3 V greater than the regulated output voltage for the chip to regulate to specifi  ca-
tions. In applications in which 2 to 3 V of headroom is not available, low dropout 
IC regulators  can be used. These regulators have typical dropout voltages of 0.15 
V for a load current of 100 mA and 0.7 V for a load current of 1 A.
On-Card Regulation versus Single-Point 
Regulation
With single-point regulation,  we need to build a power supply with a large voltage 
regulator and then distribute the regulated voltage to all the different cards  (print-
ed-circuit boards) in the system. This creates problems. To begin with, the single 
regulator has to provide a large load current equal to the sum of all the card cur-
rents. Second, noise or other electromagnetic interference (EMI)  can be  induced 
on the connecting wires between the regulated power supply and the cards.
Because IC regulators are inexpensive, electronic systems that have 
many cards often use on-card regulation.  This means that each card has its own 
three-terminal regulator to supply the voltage used by the components on that 
card. By using on-card regulation, we can deliver an unregulated voltage from a 
power supply to each card and have a local IC regulator take care of regulating 
the voltage for its card. This eliminates the problems of the large load current and 
noise pickup associated with single-point regulation. 
Load and Line Regulation Redeﬁ  ned
Up to now, we have used the original defi  nitions for load and line regulation. Man-
ufacturers of fi  xed IC regulators prefer to specify the change in load voltage for a Regulated Power Supplies  979range of load and line conditions. Here are defi  nitions for load and line  regulation 
used on the data sheets of fi  xed regulators:
Load regulation 5 DVout for a range of load current
  Line regulation 5 DVout for a range of input voltage
For instance, the LM7815 is an IC regulator that produces a fi  xed positive output 
voltage of 15 V . The data sheet lists the typical load and line regulation as follows:
Load regulation 5 12 mV for IL 5 5 mA to 1.5 A
  Line regulation 5 4 mV for Vin 5 17.5 V to 30 V
The load regulation will depend on the conditions of measurement. The foregoing 
load regulation is for TJ 5 25°C and Vin 5 23 V . Similarly, the foregoing line reg-
ulation is for TJ 5 25°C and IL 5 500 mA. In each case, the junction temperature 
of the device is 25°C.
The LM78XX Series
The LM78XX series (where XX 5 05, 06, 08, 10, 12, 15, 18, or 24) is typical of 
the three-terminal voltage regulators. The 7805 produces an output of 15 V , the 
7806 produces 16 V , the 7808 produces 18 V , and so on, up to the 7824, which 
produces an output of 124 V .
Figure 22-17 shows the functional block diagram for the 78XX series. A 
built-in reference voltage Vref drives the noninverting input of an amplifi  er. The 
voltage regulation is similar to our earlier discussion. A voltage divider consisting 
of R19 and R29 samples the output voltage and returns a feedback voltage to the 
inverting input of a high-gain amplifi  er. The output voltage is given by:
Vout 5   R19 1 R29 ________  R19   Vref
In this equation, the reference voltage is equivalent to the zener voltage 
in our earlier discussions. The primes attached to R19 and R29 indicate that these 
 resistors are inside the IC itself rather than being external resistors. These resistors 
are factory-trimmed to get the different output voltages (5 to 24 V) in the 78XX 
series. The tolerance of the output voltage is 64 percent.
The LM78XX includes a pass transistor that can handle 1 A of load 
current, provided that adequate heat sinking is used. Also included are thermal 
shutdown and current limiting. Thermal shutdown  means that the chip will shut

a precaution against excessive power dissipation, which depends on the ambient 
temperature, type of heat sinking, and other variables. Because of thermal shut-
down and current limiting, devices in the 78XX series are almost indestructible.
Fixed Regulator
Figure 22-18 a shows an LM7805 connected as a fi  xed voltage regulator. Pin 1 is 
the input, pin 3 is the output, and pin 2 is ground. The LM7805 has an output volt-
age of 15 V and a maximum load current over 1 A. The typical load regulation is 
10 mV for a load current between 5 mA and 1.5 A. The typical line regulation is 
3 mV for an input voltage of 7 to 25 V . It also has a ripple rejection of 80 dB, 
which means that it will reduce the input ripple by a factor of 10,000. With an out-
put resistance of approximately 0.01 V, the LM7805 is a very stiff voltage source 
to all loads within its current rating.
When an IC is more than 6 inches from the fi  lter capacitor of the unregu-
lated power supply, the inductance of the connecting wire may produce oscillations 
 inside the IC. This is why manufacturers recommend using a bypass capacitor C1 on 
pin 1 (Fig. 22-18 b). To improve the transient response of the regulated output  voltage, 
a bypass capacitor C2 is sometimes used on pin 3. Typical values for either bypass 
capacitor are from 0.1 to l /H9262F. The data sheet of the 78XX series suggests using 
a 0.33 /H9262F or larger tantalum, mylar, or other capacitor with low internal impedance 
at high frequencies for the input capacitor and 0.1 /H9262F for the output capacitor.
Any regulator in the 78XX series has a dropout voltage of 2 to 3 V, de-
pending on the output voltage. This means that the input voltage must be at least 
2 to 3 V greater than the output voltage. Otherwise, the chip stops regulating. 
Also, there is a maximum input voltage because of excessive power dissipation. 
For instance, the LM7805 will regulate over an input range of approximately 
8 to 20 V. The data sheet for the 78XX series gives the minimum and maximum 
input voltages for the other preset output voltages.
The LM79XX Series
The LM79XX series is a group of negative voltage regulators with preset voltages of 
25, 26, 28, 210, 212, 215, 218, or 224 V . For instance, an LM7905  produces 
a regulated output voltage of 25 V . At the other extreme, an LM7924 produces an 
output of 224 V . With the LM79XX series, the load-current capa bility is over 1 A 
with adequate heat sinking. The LM79XX series is similar to the 78XX series and 
includes current limiting, thermal shutdown, and excellent ripple rejection.
Regulated Dual Supplies
By combining an LM78XX and an LM79XX, as shown in Fig. 22-l9, we can regu-
late the output of a dual supply. The LM78XX regulates the positive output, and the 
LM79XX handles the negative output. The input capacitors prevent oscillations, +Vin

sheet recommends adding two diodes to ensure that both regulators can turn on 
under all operating conditions.
An alternative solution for dual supplies is to use a dual-tracking regu-
lator. This is an IC that contains a positive and a negative regulator in a single IC 
package. When adjustable, this type of IC can vary the dual supplies with a single 
variable resistor.
Adjustable Regulators
A number of IC regulators (LM317, LM337, LM338, and LM350) are adjustable. 
These have maximum load currents from 1.5 to 5 A. For instance, the LM317 is 
a three-terminal positive voltage regulator that can supply 1.5 A of load current 
over an adjustable output range of 1.25 to 37 V . The ripple rejection is 80 dB. This 
means that the input ripple is 10,000 smaller at the output of the IC regulator.
Again, manufacturers redefi  ne the load and line regulation to suit the 
characteristics of the IC regulator. Here are defi  nitions for load and line regulation 
used on the data sheets of adjustable regulators:
Load regulation 5 Percent change in Vout for a range in load current
  Line regulation 5 Percent change in Vout per volt of input change
For instance, the data sheet of an LM317 lists these typical load and line regulations:
Load regulation 5 0.3% for IL 5 10 mA to 1.5 A
  Line regulation 5 0.02% per volt
Since the output voltage is adjustable between 1.25 and 37 V , it makes sense to 
specify the load regulation as a percent. For instance, if the regulated voltage is 
adjusted to 10 V , the foregoing load regulation means that the output voltage will 
remain within 0.3 percent of 10 V (or 30 mV) when the load current changes from 
10 mA to 1.5 A.
The line regulation is 0.02 percent per volt. This means that the output 
voltage changes only 0.02 percent for each volt of input change. If the regulated 
output is set at 10 V and the input voltage increases by 3 V, the output voltage will 
increase by 0.06 percent, equivalent to 60 mV.
Figure 22-20 shows an unregulated supply driving an LM317 circuit. 
The data sheet of an LM317 gives this formula for output voltage:
Vout 5   R1 1 R2 _______  R1   Vref 1 IADJR2 (22-18)
In this equation, Vref has a value of 1.25 V and IADJ has a typical value of 50 /H9262A. 
In Fig. 22-20, IADJ is the current fl  owing through the middle pin (the one between 
the input and the output pins). Because this current can change with temperature, 
load current, and other factors, a designer usually makes the fi  rst term in Eq. (22-18)

In Fig. 22-20, the value of the 
filter capacitor C has to be large 
enough to ensure that Vin re-
mains at least 2 or 3 V higher 
than Vout when Vout and IL are 
both at their maximum values. 
This means that C has to be a 
very large filter capacitor.982 Chapter 22much greater than the second. This is why we can use the following equation for 
all preliminary analyses of an LM317:
Vout >   R1 1 R2 _______  R1   (1.25 V) (22-19)
Ripple Rejection
The ripple rejection of an IC voltage regulator is high, from about 65 to 80 dB. 
This is a tremendous advantage because it means that we do not have to use bulky 
LC fi  lters in the power supply to minimize the ripple. All we need is a capac-
itor-input fi  lter that reduces the peak-to-peak ripple to about 10 percent of the 
unregulated voltage out of the power supply.
For instance, the LM7805 has a typical ripple rejection of 80 dB. If a 
bridge rectifi  er and a capacitor-input fi  lter produce an unregulated output voltage 
of 10 V with a peak-to-peak ripple of 1 V, we can use an LM7805 to produce a 
regulated output voltage of 5 V with a peak-to-peak ripple of only 0.1 mV. Elimi-
nating bulky LC fi  lters in an unregulated power supply is a bonus that comes with 
IC voltage regulators.

What is the load current in Fig. 22-21? What is the output ripple?
SOLUTION  The LM7812 produces a regulated output voltage of 112 V . Therefore, the load current is:
IL 5   12 V ______ 100 V   5 120 mA
We can calculate the peak-to-peak input ripple with the equation given in Chap. 4:
VR 5   IL ___ fC   5   120 mA  ________________   (120 Hz)(1000 /H9262F)   5 1 Vsinking, these regulators can produce a load current up to 1.5 A. Load regulation is 
between 10 and 12 mV . Line regulation is between 3 and 18 mV . Ripple rejection 
is best at the lowest voltage (80 dB) and worst at the highest voltage (66 dB). The 
dropout voltage is 2 V for the entire series. Output resistance increases from 8 to 
28 m V between the lowest and highest output voltages.
The LM78L05 and LM78L12 are low-power versions of their standard 
counterparts, the LM7805 and LM7812. These low-power IC regulators  are avail-
able in TO-92 packages, which do not require heat sinking. As shown in Summary 
Table 22-1, the LM78L05 and LM78L12 can produce load currents up to 100 mA.
The LM2931 is included as an example of a low-dropout regulator. 
This adjustable regulator can produce output voltages between 3 and 24 V with a 
load current up to 100 mA. Notice that the dropout voltage is only 0.3 V, which 
means that the input voltage need be only 0.3 V greater than the regulated output 
voltage.
The LM7905, LM7912, and LM7915 are widely used negative regu-
lators. Their parameters are similar to those of their LM78XX counterparts. 
The LM317 and LM337 are adjustable positive and negative regulators that can 
 deliver load currents up to 1.5 A. Finally, the LM338 is an adjustable positive 
 regulator that can produce a load voltage between 1.2 and 32 V with a load  current 
up to 5 A.
All the regulators listed in Summary Table 22-1 have thermal shutdown.
This means that the regulator will cut off the pass transistor and shut down the 
operation if the chip temperature becomes too high. When the device cools off, it 
will  attempt to restart. If whatever caused the excessive temperature has been re-
moved, the regulator will function normally. If not, it will shut down again. Ther-
mal shutdown is an advantage that monolithic regulators offer for safe operation.

The LM7805 can regulate to specifi  cations with an input voltage between 7.5 and 20 V. What is the maximum effi  ciency? 
What is the minimum effi  ciency?
SOLUTION  The LM7805 produces an output of 5 V . With Eq. (22-13), the maximum effi  ciency is:
Effi ciency >   Vout ____ Vin   3 100% 5   5 V _____ 7.5 V   3 100% 5 67%
This high effi  ciency is possible only because the headroom voltage is approaching the dropout voltage.
On the other hand, the minimum effi  ciency occurs when the input voltage is maximum. For this condition, the 
headroom voltage is maximum and the power dissipation in the pass transistor is maximum. The minimum effi  ciency is:
Effi ciency >   5 V _____ 20 V   3 100% 5 25%
Since the unregulated input voltage is usually somewhere between the extremes in input voltage, the effi  ciency we can 
 expect with an LM7805 is in the range of 40 to 50 percent.Regulated Power Supplies  98522-5   Current Boosters
Even though the 78XX regulators of Summary Table 22-1 have a maximum load 
current of 1.5 A, the data sheet shows many parameters measured at 1 A. For in-
stance, a load current of 1 A is used for measuring line regulation, ripple rejection, 
and output  resistance. For this reason, we will establish 1 A as a practical limit on 
the load current when using a 78XX device.
The Outboard Transistor
One way to get more load current is to use a current booster . The idea is similar 
to what we did to boost the output current of an op amp. Recall that we used the op 
amp to supply the base current for an external transistor, which produced a much 
larger output current.
Figure 22-22 shows how we can use an external transistor to boost the 
output current. The external transistor, called an outboard transistor,  is a power 
transistor. R1 is a current-sensing resistor of 0.7 V. Notice that we are using 
0.7 V instead of 0.6 V. We are using 0.7 V because a power transistor needs more 
base voltage than does a small-signal transistor (used in the previous discussion).
When the current is less than 1 A, the voltage across the current-sensing 
resistor is less than 0.7 V and the transistor is off. When the load current is greater 
than 1 A, the transistor turns on and supplies almost all the load current above 
1 A. Here is why: When the load current increases, the current through the 78XX 
 increases slightly. This produces more voltage across the current-sensing resistor, 
which makes the outboard transistor conduct more heavily.
Each time we increase the load current, the current through the 78XX de-
vice increases slightly, producing more voltage across the current-sensing resis-
tor. In this way, the outboard transistor produces the bulk of any increase in load 
current above 1 A, with only a small increase in the current through the 78XX.
For large load currents, the base current in the outboard transistor 
 becomes large. The 78XX chip has to supply this base current in addition to its 
share of load current. When the large base current becomes a problem, a designer 
may use a Darlington connection for the outboard transistor. In this case, the 
 current-sensing voltage is approximately 1.4 V, which means that R1 should be 
 increased to approximately 1.4 V.
Short-Circuit Protection
Figure 22-23 shows how to add short-circuit protection to the circuit. We are using 
two current-sensing resistors: one to drive the outboard transistor Q2 and a second 
to turn on Q1 for short-circuit protection. For this discussion, 1 A is where Q2
conducts, and 10 A is where Q1 provides short-circuit protection.

–Figure 22-22  Outboard transistor increases load current.986 Chapter 22Here is how the circuit works: When the load current is greater than 1 A, 
the voltage across R1 is greater than 0.7 V. This turns on the outboard transistor 
Q2, which supplies all the load current above 1 A. The outboard current has to 
pass through R2. Since R2 is only 0.07 V, the voltage across it is less than 0.7 V as 
long as the outboard current is less than 10 A.
When the outboard current is 10 A, the voltage across R2 is:
V2 5 (10 A)(0.07 V) 5 0.7 V
This means that the current-limiting transistor Q1 is on the verge of turning on. 
When the outboard current is greater than 10 A, Q1 conducts heavily. Since the 
collector current of Q1 passes through the 78XX, the device overheats and pro-
duces thermal shutdown.
A fi  nal point: Using an outboard transistor does not improve the effi  -
ciency of a series regulator. With typical headroom voltages, the effi  ciency is 
around 40 to 50 percent. To get higher effi  ciency with large headroom voltages, 
we have to use a fundamentally different approach to voltage regulation.
22-6   DC-to-DC Converters
Sometimes we want to convert a dc voltage of one value to a dc voltage of another 
value. For instance, if we have a system with a positive supply of 15 V , we can 
use a dc-to-dc converter  to convert this 15 V to an output of 115 V . Then we 
would have two supply voltages for our system: 15 and 115 V .
DC-to-dc converters are very effi  cient. Because they switch transistors 
on and off, transistor power dissipation is greatly reduced. Typical effi  ciencies 
are from 65 to 85 percent. This section discusses unregulated dc-to-dc convert-
ers. The next section is about regulated dc-to-dc converters that use pulse-width 
modulation. These dc-to-dc converters are usually called switching regulators .
Basic Idea
In a typical unregulated dc-to-dc converter, the input dc voltage is applied to a 
square-wave oscillator. The peak-to-peak value of the square wave is proportional 
to the input voltage. The square wave is used to drive the primary winding of a 
transformer, as shown in Fig. 22-24. The higher the frequency, the smaller the 
transformer and fi  lter components. If the frequency is too high, however, it is dif-
fi cult to produce a square wave with vertical transitions. Usually, the frequency of 
the square wave is between 10 and 100 kHz.LM340-XX

Q1Figure 22-23  Outboard transistor with current limiting.Regulated Power Supplies  987To improve the effi  ciency, a special kind of transformer is used in more 
expensive dc-to-dc converters. The transformer has a toroidal core with a rectan-
gular hysteresis loop. This produces a secondary voltage that is a square wave. 
The secondary voltage can then be rectifi  ed and fi  ltered to get a dc output voltage. 
By selecting a different turns ratio, we can step the secondary voltage up or down. 
This way, we can build dc-to-dc converters that step the dc input voltage either 
up or down.
One common dc-to-dc conversion is 15 to 615 V. In digital systems, 
15 V is a standard supply voltage for most ICs. But linear ICs, like op amps, may 
require 615 V. In a case like this, you may fi  nd a low-power dc-to-dc converter 
converting an input 15 V dc to dual outputs of 615 V dc.
One Possible Design
There are many ways to design a dc-to-dc converter, depending on whether bipo-
lar junction or power FETs are used, the switching frequency, whether the input 
voltage is stepped up or down, and so on. Figure 22-25 shows a design example 
that uses bipolar junction power transistors. Here is how it works: A relaxation 
 oscillator produces a square wave whose frequency is set by R3 and C2. This 
 frequency is in the kilohertz range; a value like 20 kHz would be typical.
The square wave drives a phase splitter  Q1, a circuit that produces two 
equal-magnitude and out-of-phase square waves. These square waves are the Vout+

during one half-cycle, and Q3 during the other half-cycle. The primary current in 
the transformer is a square wave. This induces a square wave across the secondary 
winding, as previously described.
The square wave of voltage out of the secondary winding drives a bridge 
rectifi  er and a capacitor-input fi  lter. Because the signal is a rectifi  ed square wave 
in kilohertz, it is easy to fi  lter. The fi  nal output is a dc voltage at some level dif-
ferent from the input.
Commercial DC-to-DC Converters
In Fig. 22-25, notice that the output of the dc-to-dc converter is unregulated. This 
is typical of inexpensive dc-to-dc converters. Unregulated dc-to-dc converters are 
commercially available with effi  ciencies of about 65 to more than 85 percent. For 
instance, inexpensive dc-to-dc converters are available for converting 15 to 612 
V at 375 mA, 15 to 19 V dc at 200 mA, 112 to 65 V at 250 mA, and so on. 
All of these converters require a fi  xed input voltage because they do not  include 
voltage regulation. Also, they use switching frequencies between 10 and 100 kHz. 
Because of this, they include RFI shielding. Some of the units have an MTBF  of 
200,000 hr. ( Note: MTBF  stands for “mean time between failure.”)
22-7   Switching Regulators
A switching regulator  falls into the general class of dc-to-dc converters because it 
will convert a dc input voltage to another dc output voltage, either lower or higher. 
But the switching regulator also includes voltage regulation, typically pulse-width 
modulation controlling the on-off time of the transistor. By changing the duty 
cycle, a switching regulator can hold the output voltage constant under varying 
line and load conditions.
The Pass Transistor
In a series regulator, the power dissipation of the pass transistor approximately 
equals the headroom voltage times the load current:
PD 5 (Vin 2 Vout)IL
If the headroom voltage equals the output voltage, the effi  ciency is approximately 
50 percent. For instance, if 10 V is the input to a 7805, the load voltage is 5 V and 
the effi  ciency is around 50 percent.
Three-terminal series regulators are very popular because they are easy to 
use and fi  ll most of our needs when the load power is less than about 10 W. When 
the load power is 10 W and the effi  ciency is 50 percent, the power dissipation of 
the pass transistor is also 10 W. This represents a lot of wasted power, as well as 
heat created inside the equipment. Around load powers of 10 W, heat sinks get very 
bulky and the temperature of enclosed equipment may rise to objectionable levels.
Switching the Pass Transistor On and Off  
The ultimate solution to the problem of low effi  ciency and high equipment tem-
perature is the switching regulator, briefl  y described earlier. With this type of reg-
ulator, the pass transistor is switched between cutoff and saturation. When the 
transistor is cut off, the power dissipation is virtually zero. When the transistor is 
saturated, the power dissipation is still very low because VCE(sat) is much less than 
the headroom voltage in a series regulator. As mentioned earlier, switching reg-
ulators can have effi  ciencies from about 75 to more than 95 percent. Because of 
the high effi  ciency and small size, switching regulators have become widely used.Regulated Power Supplies  989Topologies
Topology  is a term often used in switching-regulator literature. It is the design 
technique or fundamental layout of a circuit. Many topologies have evolved for 
switching regulators because some are better suited to an application than others.
Summary Table 22-2 shows many of the topologies used for switching 
regulators. The fi  rst three are the most basic. They use the fewest number of parts 
and can deliver load power up to about 150 W. Because their complexity is low, 
they are widely used, especially with IC switching regulators.
When transformer isolation is preferred, the fl  yback and the half-forward 
topologies can be used for load power up to 150 W. When the load power is from 
150 to 2000 W, the push-pull, half-bridge, and full-bridge topologies are used. 
Since the last three topologies use more components, the circuit complexity is 
high.
Buck Regulator
Figure 22-26 a shows a buck regulator , the most basic topology for switching 
regulators. A buck regulator always steps the voltage down. A transistor, either a 
bipolar junction or a power FET, is used as the switching device. A rectangular 
signal out of the pulse-width modulator closes and opens the switch. A compara-
tor controls the duty cycle of the pulses. For instance, the pulse-width modulator 
may be a one-shot multivibrator with a comparator driving the control input. As 
discussed in Chap. 21 with a monostable 555 timer, an increase in control voltage 
increases the duty cycle.
When the pulse is high, the switch is closed. This reverse-biases the 
diode so that all the input current fl  ows through the inductor. This current creates 
a magnetic fi  eld around the inductor. The amount of stored energy in the magnetic 
fi  eld is given by:
Energy  5 0.5Li2 (22-20)
The current through the inductor also charges the capacitor and supplies 
current to the load. While the switch is closed, the voltage across the inductor has 
the plus-minus polarity shown in Fig. 22-26 b. As the current through the inductor 
increases, more energy is stored in the magnetic fi  eld.Summary Table 22-2 Switching-Regulator Topologies

fi eld around the inductor starts collapsing and induces a reverse voltage across 
the inductor, as shown in Fig. 22-26 c. This reverse voltage is called the inductive 
kick. Because of the inductive kick, the diode is forward biased and the current 
through the inductor continues to fl  ow in the same direction. At this time, the 
inductor is returning its stored energy to the circuit. In other words, the inductor 
acts like a source and continues supplying current for the load.
Current fl  ows through the inductor until the inductor returns all its  energy 
to the circuit (discontinuous mode) or until the switch closes again (continuous 
mode), whichever comes fi  rst. In either case, the capacitor will also source load 
current during part of the time that the switch is open. This way, the ripple across 
the load is minimized.
The switch is being continuously closed and opened. The frequency of 
this switching can be from 10 to more than 100 kHz. (Some IC regulators switch at 
more than 1 MHz.) The current through the inductor is always in the same  direction, 
passing through either the switch or the diode at different times in the cycle.
With a stiff input voltage and an ideal diode, a rectangular voltage wave-
form appears at the input to the choke-input fi  lter  (see Fig. 22-26 d). The output 
of a choke-input fi  lter equals the dc or average value of the input to the fi  lter. The 
average value is related to the duty cycle and is given by:
Vout 5 DV in (22-21)
The larger the duty cycle, the larger the dc output voltage.
When the power is fi  rst turned on, there is no output voltage and no feed-
back voltage from the R1-R2 voltage divider. Therefore, the comparator  output 
is very large and the duty cycle approaches 100 percent. As the output voltage +VinQ

which  reduces the duty cycle. At some point, the output voltage reaches an equi-
librium value at which the feedback voltage produces a duty cycle that gives the 
same output voltage.
Because of the high gain of the comparator, the virtual short between the 
input terminals of the comparator means that:
VFB > VREF
From this, we can derive this expression for the output voltage:
Vout 5   R1 1 R2 _______  R1   VREF (22-22)
After equilibrium sets in, any attempted change in the output voltage, 
whether caused by line or load changes, will be almost entirely offset by the neg-
ative feedback. For instance, if the output voltage tries to increase, the feedback 
voltage reduces the comparator output. This reduces the duty cycle and the output 
voltage. The net effect is only a slight increase in output voltage, much less than 
without the negative feedback.
Similarly, if the output voltage tries to decrease because of a line or load 
change, the feedback voltage is smaller and the comparator output is larger. This 
increases the duty cycle and produces a larger output voltage that offsets almost 
all the attempted decrease in output voltage.

output voltage equal to peak input.992 Chapter 22is similar to that for a buck regulator in some ways but very different in others. 
For instance, when the pulse is high, the switch is closed and energy is stored in 
the magnetic fi  eld, as previously described.
When the pulse goes low, the switch opens. Again, the magnetic fi  eld 
around the inductor collapses and induces a reverse voltage across the inductor, 
as shown in Fig. 22-27 b. Notice that the input voltage now adds to the inductive 
kick. This means that the peak voltage on the right end of the inductor is:
Vp 5 Vin 1 Vkick (22-23)
The inductive kick depends on how much energy is stored in the magnetic fi  eld. 
Stated another way, Vkick is proportional to the duty cycle.
With a stiff input voltage, a rectangular voltage waveform appears at the 
input to the capacitor-input fi  lter  of Fig. 22-27 c. Therefore, the regulated output 
voltage approximately equals the peak voltage given by Eq. (22-23). Because 
Vkick is always greater than zero, Vp is always greater than Vin. This is why a boost 
regulator always steps the voltage up.
Aside from using a capacitor-input fi  lter rather than a choke-input fi  lter, 
the regulation with boost topology is similar to that with buck topology. Because 
of the high gain of the comparator, the feedback almost equals the reference volt-
age. Therefore, the regulated output voltage is still given by Eq. (22-22). If the 
output voltage tries to increase, there is more feedback voltage, resulting in less 
comparator output, a smaller duty cycle, and less inductive kick. This reduces the 
peak voltage, which offsets the attempted increase in output voltage. If the output 
voltage tries to decrease, the smaller feedback voltage results in a larger peak 
voltage, which offsets the attempted decrease in output voltage.
Buck-Boost Regulator
Figure 22-28 a shows a buck-boost regulator,  the third most basic topology for 
switching regulators. A buck-boost regulator always produces a negative output 
voltage when driven by a positive input voltage. When the PWM output is high, 
the switch is closed and energy is stored in the magnetic fi  eld. At this time, the 
voltage across the inductor equals Vin, with the polarity shown in Fig. 22-28 b.
When the pulse goes low, the switch opens. Again, the magnetic fi  eld 
around the inductor collapses and induces a kick voltage across the inductor, as 
shown in Fig. 22-28 c. The kick voltage is proportional to the energy stored in the 
magnetic fi  eld, which is controlled by the duty cycle. If the duty cycle is low, the 
kick voltage approaches zero. If the duty cycle is high, the kick voltage can be 
greater than Vin, depending on how much energy is stored in the magnetic fi  eld.
In Fig. 22-28 d, the magnitude of the peak voltage may be less than or 
greater than the input voltage. The diode and the capacitor-input fi  lter then produce 
an output voltage equal to 2Vp. Since the magnitude of this output voltage can be 
less than or greater than the input voltage, the topology is called buck-boost.
An inverting amplifi  er is used in Fig. 22-28 a to invert the feedback volt-
age before it reaches the inverting input of the comparator. The voltage regulation 
then works as previously described. Attempted increases in output voltage reduce 
the duty cycle, which reduces the peak voltage. Attempted decreases in output 
voltage increase the duty cycle. Either way, the negative feedback holds the out-
put voltage almost constant.
Monolithic Buck Regulators
Some IC switching regulators have only fi  ve external pins. For instance, the 
LT1074 is a monolithic bipolar switching regulator that uses buck topology. It 
contains most of the components discussed earlier, such as a reference voltage of 
2.21 V , a switching device, an internal oscillator, a pulse-width modulator, and a Regulated Power Supplies  993comparator. It runs at a switching frequency of 100 kHz, can handle input voltages 
from 18 to 140 V dc, and has an effi  ciency of 75 to 90 percent for load currents 
from 1 to 5 A.
Figure 22-29 shows an LT1074 connected as a buck regulator. Pin 1 
(FB) is for the feedback voltage. Pin 2 (COMP) is for frequency compensation to 
prevent oscillations at higher frequencies. Pin 3 (GND) is ground. Pin 4 (OUT) is 
the switched output of the internal switching device. Pin 5 (IN) is for the dc input 
voltage.VoutQ

–++Figure 22-29  Buck regulator using LT1074.994 Chapter 22D1, L1, C1, R1, and R2 serve the same functions as described in the earlier 
discussion of a buck regulator. But notice the use of a Schottky diode to improve 
the effi  ciency of the regulator. Because the Schottky diode has a lower knee volt-
age, it wastes less power. The data sheet of an LT1074 recommends adding a 
 capacitor C2 from 200 to 470 /H9262F across the input for line fi  ltering. Also recom-
mended are a resistor R3 of 2.7 k V and a capacitor C3 of 0.01 /H9262F to stabilize the 
feedback loop (prevent oscillations).
The LT1074 is widely used. A look at Fig. 22-29 tells us why. The cir-
cuit is incredibly simple, considering that it is a switching regulator, one of the 
most diffi  cult of all circuits to design and build in discrete form. Fortunately, the 
IC  designers have done all the hard work because the LT1074 includes everything 
except the components that cannot be integrated (choke and fi  lter capacitors) and 
those left for the user to select ( R1 and R2). By selecting values for R1 and R2, we 
can get regulated output voltage from about 2.5 to 38 V. Since the reference volt-
age of an LT1074 is 2.21 V, the output voltage is given by:
Vout 5   R1 1 R2 _______  R1   (2.21 V) (22-24)
The headroom voltage should be at least 2 V because the internal switching device 
consists of a pnp transistor driving an npn Darlington. The overall switch drop can 
be as high as 2 V with high currents.
Monolithic Boost Regulators
The MAX631 is a monolithic CMOS switching regulator that uses boost topol-
ogy to produce a regulated output. This low-power IC switching regulator has a 
switching frequency of 50 kHz, an input voltage of 2 to 5 V , and an effi  ciency of 
about 80 percent. The MAX631 is the ultimate in simplicity because it requires 
only two external components.
For instance, Fig. 22-30 shows a MAX631 connected as a boost regula-
tor, producing a fi  xed output voltage of 15 V with an input voltage of 12 to 15 V. 
The input voltage often comes from a battery because one of the applications 
for these IC regulators is in portable instruments. The data sheet recommends an 
 inductor of 330 /H9262H and a capacitor of 100 /H9262F.
The MAX631 is an 8-pin device whose unused pins are either grounded 
or left unconnected. In Fig. 22-30, pin 1 (LBI) can be used for low-battery detec-
tion. When grounded, it has no effect. Although typically used as a fi  xed output 
regulator, the MAX631 can use an external voltage divider to provide a feedback 
voltage to pin 7 (FB). When pin 7 is grounded as shown, the output voltage is the 
factory preset value of 15 V.
Besides the MAX631, there is the MAX632, which produces an output 
of 112 V, and the MAX633, which produces an output of 115 V. The MAX631 
through MAX633 regulators include pin 6, called the charge pump,  which is a

swings from 0 to Vout at the oscillator frequency and can be negatively clamped 
and peak-detected to get a negative output voltage.
For instance, Fig. 22-31 a shows how a MAX633 uses its charge pump to 
get an output of approximately 212 V. C1 and D1 are a negative clamper. D2 and 
C2 are a negative peak detector. Here is how the charge pump works: Figure 22-31 b
shows the ideal voltage waveform coming out of pin 6. Because of the negative 
clamper, the ideal voltage waveform across D1 is the negatively clamped wave-
form of Fig. 22-31 c. This waveform drives the negative peak detector to produce 
an output of approximately 212 V at 20 mA. The magnitude of this voltage is 
 approximately 3 V less than the output voltage because of the two diode drops 
(D1 and D2) and the drop across the output impedance of the buffer (around 30 V).
If we use a battery to supply the input voltage to a linear regulator, the 
output voltage is always smaller. Boost regulators not only have better effi  ciency 
than linear regulators, they also can step up the voltage in a battery-powered sys-
tem. This is very important and explains why monolithic boost regulators are 
so widely used. The availability of low-cost rechargeable batteries has made the 
monolithic boost regulator a standard choice for battery-powered systems.
The MAX631 through MAX633 devices have an internal reference volt-
age of 1.31 V. When these switching regulators are used with an external voltage 
divider, the following equation gives the regulated output voltage:

Monolithic Buck-Boost Regulators
The internal design of the LT1074 can support a buck-boost external connection. 
Figure 22-32 shows the LT1074 connected as a buck-boost regulator. Again, we 
are using a Schottky diode to improve the effi  ciency. As previously discussed, 
 energy is stored in the inductor’s magnetic fi  eld when the internal switch is 
closed. When the switch opens, the magnetic fi  eld collapses and forward-biases 
the diode. The negative kick voltage across the inductor is peak-detected by the 
capacitor-input fi  lter to produce 2Vout.4

has to be at least 2 V greater than the output of 5 V, which means a minimum input 
voltage of 7 V. A more comfortable headroom will use an input voltage of 8 V.

DC-to-DC monolithic converters can be used in a variety of applications. One 
such application is the ability to effi  ciently drive LEDs. The CAT4139 is a boost 
regulator, also called a DC/DC step-up converter, designed to provide a constant 
current when driving LED strings. Figure 22-33 shows a simplifi  ed block diagram 
of the CAT4139. With only fi  ve pin connections and minimal external compo-
nents required, this LED driver is able to provide switching current up to 750 mA 
and can drive LED strings up to 22 V .
Let’s examine the basic functions of this IC. VIN is the IC’s power supply 
input connection. The input voltage can range from 2.8 V up to 5.5 V for constant 
current output operation. If VIN drops below 1.9 V, a feature called under-voltage 
lock out (UVLO) occurs and the device stops switching. A logic low ( , 0.4 V) 
on the shutdown logic input pin SHDN puts the CAT4139 into shutdown mode. 
During this time, the IC draws nearly zero current from the input supply voltage. 
When the SHDN pin voltage is higher than 1.5 V, the device is enabled. The 
SHDN input can also be driven with a PWM signal to control the output current 
from 0 to 100% of its normal ILED output current level. The ground pin, GND, is 
the ground reference pin and should be connected directly to the ground plane on 
the printed-circuit board for this surface mount device.
The switch pin SW is connected to the drain of an internal MOSFET 
switch and to the junction of the series inductor and Schottky diode. The MOS-
FET is switched at a 1 MHz frequency and with a variable duty cycle from the 
PWM and logic block. A current-sensing resistor RS is connected to the source 
lead of the MOSFET. The MOSFET current produces a voltage drop across the 
resistor proportional to the average current level. This voltage is applied to a cur-
rent sense op amp for current limiting and control. Because this IC is a boost con-
verter, the voltage at the SW pin will be higher than the input supply voltage. If 
this voltage reaches 24 V, an over-voltage protection circuit will place the device

the 40 V maximum rating.
In Fig. 22-33, an effective series resistor is connected from the cathode 
of the LED string load to ground. The voltage across this resistor is applied to 
the feedback pin FB on the IC. This voltage is compared to a 300 mV inter-
nal reference voltage. The on/off duty cycle of the internal switch is adjusted 
and controlled to maintain a constant regulated voltage across the resistor. Since 
the current through the LEDs also fl  ows through this series resistor, the output 
current can be programmed by:
 IOUT 5   0.3 V _____ R   (22-26)
For example, if the series resistor is 10 V, the output current is set to 30 mA. If 
the resistor is changed to 1 V, the output current is now programmed to 300 mA.
A typical application of the CAT4139 is shown in Fig. 22-34. An input 
voltage of 5 V is applied to VIN. A 4.7 mF input capacitor C1 is connected as close 
as possible to the input voltage pin. A 1 mF capacitor C2 is connected to the out-
put of the Schottky diode. For both C1 and C2, ceramic capacitors with an X5R 
or X7R rating are recommended because of their temperature range stability. 
A 22 mH inductor is shown in Fig. 22-34. This inductor must be able to handle 
over 750 mA and should have a low series dc resistance. The Schottky diode used 
must be able to safely carry the peak current fl  owing through it. For high circuit 
effi ciency, the diode must have a low forward voltage drop and have a frequency 
response that can handle the 1 MHz switching rate.
As shown in Fig. 22-34, several strings of LEDs can be placed in a  
series/parallel arrangement as the LED load. In this case, nine strings of LEDs 
are used. Each string of LEDs requires 20 mA of current, for a total load current 
of 180 mA. By rearranging Eq. (22-36), the value of series resistor R1 can be 
found by:
 R1 5   0.3 V ____ _ IOUT   5   0.3 V _______ 180 mA   5 1.66 V
In Fig. 22-34, a 1.62- V resistor is used. Instead of using a series/parallel arrange-
ment of 20 mA LEDs, this step-up converter could also drive medium to high-
power LEDs requiring hundreds of mAs. VOUTLVIN

Application Example 22-17
What does the circuit of Fig. 22-35 do?
SOLUTION  The circuit of Fig. 22-35 is a solar LED lamp application. It uses a solar panel to charge up a battery. The 
battery supplies the input voltage to the CAT4139 constant current driver which drives the LED string. So how does this 
circuit work?
 The solar panel consists of a solar module constructed with 10 cells connected in series. Each cell produces approx-
imately 0.5 V to 1.0 V depending on ambient solar conditions. This produces an output voltage of 5–10 V, under no load, 
between the SOLAR 1 output and ground GND.
 When the output of the solar module is high enough, it charges up a 3.7 V Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) cell through diode 
D2. The Li-Ion cell (or parallel cells if needed) has built-in protection for overcharge current/voltage or discharge current. 
The voltage at SOLAR 1 also provides the input base-bias for transistor Q1. When Q1 conducts, the voltage drop across R1 
pulls the collector towards ground and the CAT4139 converter goes into a shutdown mode.
 When the ambient light is low, the output of the solar module drops signifi  cantly. The low output voltage at 
SOLAR+ no longer forward biases Q1. This transistor turns off and its collector voltage rises to the BAT 1 level. If the 
 Li-Ion cell is charged to a suffi  cient level, the converter goes into switching mode and the voltage at BAT 1 supplies the 
input voltage to the converter’s input pin VIN. During this time, D2 is used to prevent reverse current fl  ow from the battery 
to the solar module. The dc-to-dc boost converter now supplies the necessary output voltage and current for the LED string. 
The constant current through the LEDs is controlled by the resistor R4 where ILED 5 0.3 V/ 3.3 V 5 91 mA.

SEC. 22-1   SUPPLY 
CHARACTERISTICS
Load regulation indicates how 
much the output voltage changes 
when the load current changes. 
Line regulation indicates how much 
the load voltage changes when the 
line voltage changes. The output 
resistance determines the load 
regulation.SEC. 22-2   SHUNT 
REGULATORS
The zener regulator is the simplest 
example of a shunt regulator. By add-
ing transistors and an op amp, we 
can build a shunt regulator that has 
excellent line and load regulation. 
The main disadvantage of a shunt 
regulator is its low effi   ciency, caused 
by power losses in the series resistor 
and shunt transistor.SEC. 22-3   SERIES 
REGULATORS
By using a pass transistor instead of 
a series resistor, we can build series 
regulators with higher effi   ciencies 
than shunt regulators. The zener 
follower is the simplest example of a 
series regulator. By adding transistors 
and an op amp, we can build series 
regulators with excellent line and 
load regulation, plus current limiting.1002  Chapter 22SEC. 22-4   MONOLITHIC LIN-
EAR REGULATORS
IC voltage regulators have one of 
the following voltages: ﬁ  xed positive, 
ﬁ  xed negative, or adjustable. IC reg-
ulators are also classiﬁ  ed as stand-
ard, low-power, or low-dropout. The 
LM78XX series is a standard line of 
ﬁ  xed regulators with output voltages 
from 5 to 24 V.
SEC. 22-5   CURRENT 
BOOSTERS
To increase the regulated load 
current of an IC regulator such as 
a 78XX device, we can use an out-
board transistor to carry most of the 
current above 1 A. By adding another transistor, we can have short-circuit 
protection.
SEC. 22-6   DC-TO-DC 
CONVERTERS
When we want to convert an input 
dc voltage to an output dc voltage of 
another value, a dc-to-dc converter is 
useful. Unregulated dc-to-dc convert-
ers have an oscillator whose output 
voltage is proportional to the input 
voltage. Typically, a push-pull ar-
rangement of transistors and a trans-
former can step this voltage up or 
down. Then, it is rectiﬁ  ed and ﬁ  ltered 
to get an output voltage diff  erent 
from the input voltage.SEC. 22-7   SWITCHING 
REGULATORS
A switching regulator is a dc-to-dc 
converter that uses pulse-width mod-
ulation to regulate the output voltage. 
By switching the pass transistor on 
and off  , the switching regulator can 
attain effi   ciencies from 70 to 95 per-
cent. The basic topologies are the 
buck (step-down), boost (step-up), 
and buck-boost (inverting). This 
type of regulator is very popular in 
computer and portable electronic 
systems.

Troubleshooting
Use Fig. 22-38 for problems 22-35 through 22-43. In 
this set of problems, you are troubleshooting a switch-
ing regulator. Before you start, look at the OK row in the 
troubleshooting table to see the normal waveforms with 
their correct peak voltages. In this exercise, most of the 
troubles are IC failures rather than resistor failures. When 
an IC fails, anything can happen. Pins may be internally 
open, shorted, and so on. No matter what the trouble 
is inside the IC, the most common symptom is a stuck 
output.  This refers to the output voltage being stuck at 
either positive or negative saturation. If the input signals 
are OK, an IC with a stuck output has to be replaced. 
The following problems will give you a chance to work 
with outputs that are stuck at either 113.5 or 213.5 V.22-35  Find Trouble 1.

and a minimum load resistance of 10 V. What is 
the output resistance of the power supply?

current of 140 mA. If the series resistance is 100 V, 
what is the load resistance?

Mathematical Derivations
This appendix contains a few selected derivations. M ore derivations are  available 
on the Instructor Resources section of Connect for Electronic Principles.  Ask 
your instructor for more details. 
Proof of Eq. (8-10)
The starting point for this derivation is the rectangular pn junction equation 
 derived by Schockley:
I 5 Is(eVq/kT 2 1) (B-1)
where I 5 total diode current
Is 5 reverse saturation current
V 5 total voltage across the depletion layer
q 5 charge on an electron
k 5 Boltzmann’s constant
T 5 absolute temperature, °C 1 273
Equation (B-1) does not include the bulk resistance on either side of the junction. 
For this reason, the equation applies to the total diode only when the voltage 
across the bulk resistance is negligible.
At room temperature, q/kT equals approximately 40, and Eq. (B-1) becomes:
I 5 Is(e40V 2 1) (B-2)
(Some books use 39 V, but this is a small difference.) To get re9, we differentiate I 
with respect to V:
  dI ___ dV   5 40Is/H928040V
Using Eq. (B-2), we can rewrite this as:
  dI ___ dV   5 40 (I 1 Is)
Taking the reciprocal gives re9:
re9 5   dV ___ dI   5   1 _________  40(I 1 Is)   5   25 mV ______ I 1 Is   (B-3)
Equation (B-3) includes the effect of reverse saturation current. In a practical 
linear amplifi  er, I is much greater than Is (otherwise, the bias is unstable). For this 
reason, the practical value of re9 is:
re9 5   25 mV ______  I  
Since we are talking about the emitter depletion layer, we add the supscript E to 
get:
re9 5   25 mV ______  IE  1012  Appendix BProof of Eq. (10-27)
In Fig. 10-18 a, the instantaneous power dissipation during the on time of the 
 transistor i s:
p 5 VCEIC
 5 VCEQ(1 2 sin /H9258)IC(sat) sin /H9258
This is for the half-cycle when the transistor is conducting; during the off half-cy-
cle, p 5 0 ideally.
The average power dissipation equals:
pav 5   area — period   5 21/H9266E/H9266
0 VCEQ (1 2 sin /H9258)IC(sat) sin /H9258 d/H9258
After evaluating the defi  nite integral over the half-cycle limits of 0 to /H9266 and 
 dividing by the period 2 /H9266, we have the average power over the entire cycle  for 
one transistor:
pav 5   1 ___ 2p   VCEQIC(sat) 32cos u 2   u __ 2  40p
5 0.068  VCEQIC(sat) (B-4)
This is power dissipation in each transistor over the entire cycle, assuming 100 
percent swing over the ac load line.
If the signal does not swing over the entire load line, the instantaneous power 
equals:
p 5 VCEIC 5 VCEQ(1 2 k sin /H9258)IC(sat)k sin /H9258
where k is a constant between 0 and 1; k represents the fraction of the load line 
being used. After integrating:
pav 5   1 ___ 2/H9266  E/H9266
0 p d/H9258
you get:
pav 5   VCEQIC(sat) —  2p   12k 2   pk2 ____ 2  2 (B-5)
Since pav is a function of k, we can differentiate and set dpav/dk equal to zero to 
fi  nd the maximizing value of k:
  dpav ____ dk   5   VCEQIC(sat) _________  2/H9266   (2 2 k/H9266) 5 0
Solving for k gives:
k 5   2 __ /H9266   5 0.636
With this value of k, Eq. (B-5) reduces to:
pav 5 0.107 VCEQIC(sat) > 0.1VCEQIC(sat)
Since IC(sat) 5 VCEQ/RL and VCEQ 5 MPP/2, the foregoing equation can be  
written as:
PD(max) 5   MPP2 _____ 40RL  Mathematical Derivations 1013Proof of Eqs. (11-15) and (11-16)
Start with the transconductance equation:
ID 5 IDSS 31 2   VGS — VGS(off)   42
 (B-6)
The derivative of this is:
dID _____ dVGS   5 gm 5 2IDSS 31 2   VGS ______ VGS(off)   4 32   1 — VGS(off)   4
or:
gm 5 2   2IDSS ______ VGS(off)   31 2   VGS ______ VGS(off)   4 (B-7)
When VGS 5 0, we get:
gm0 5 2   2IDSS ______ VGS(off)   (B-8)
or by rearranging:
VGS(off) 5 2   2IDSS _____ gm0  
This proves Eq. (11-15). By substituting the left member of Eq. (B-8) into Eq. (B-7):
gm 5 gm0 31 2   VGS ______ VGS(off)   4
This is the proof of Eq. (11-16).
Proof of Eq. (16-2)
The equation of a sinusoidal voltage is:
v 5 VP sin /H9275t
The derivative with respect to time is:
  dv ___ dt   5 /H9275VP cos /H9275t
The maximum rate of change occurs for t 5 0. Furthermore, as the frequency 
increases, we reach the point at which the maximum rate of change just equals the 
slew rate. At this critical point:
SR 5 1  dv ___ dt  2max 5 /H9275maxVP 5 2/H9266fmaxVP
Solving for fmax in terms of SR, we get:
fmax 5   SR _____ 2/H9266VP  
Proof of Eq. (17-10)
Here is the derivation for closed-loop output impedance. Begin with:
Av(CL) 5   AVOL _________  1 1 AVOLB  1014  Appendix BSubstitute:
Av 5 Au   RL ________ rout 1 RL  
where Av is the loaded gain ( RL connected) and Au is the unloaded gain ( RL discon-
nected). After substitution for Av, the closed-loop gain simplifi  es to:
Av(CL) 5   Au _______________   1 1 AuB 1 rout/RL  
When:
1 1 AuB 5   rout ___ RL  
Av(CL) will drop in half, implying that the load resistance matches the Thevenin 
output resistance of the feedback amplifi  er. Solving for RL gives:
RL 5   rout _______ 1 1 AuB  
This is the value of load resistance that forces the closed-loop voltage gain to drop 
in half, which is equivalent to saying it equals the closed-loop output impedance:
rout(CL) 5   rout _______ 1 1 AuB  
In any practical feedback amplifi  er, rout is much smaller than RL so that AVOL 
 approximately equals Au. This is why you almost always see the following 
 expression for output impedance:
rout(CL) 5   rout _________  1 1 AVOLB  
where rout(CL) 5 closed-loop output impedance
rout 5 open-loop output impedance
AVOLB 5 open-loop gain
Proof of Eq. (17-23)
Because of the virtual ground in Fig. 17-12, essentially all of the input current 
fl  ows through R1. Summing voltages around the circuit gives:
2verror 1 iinR2 2 (iout 2 iin)R1 5 0 (B-9)
With the following substitutions:
verror 5   vout _____ AVOL  
and:
vout 5 ioutRL 1 (iout 2 iin)R1 
Eq. (B-9) can be rearranged as:
  iout ___ iin   5   AVOLR2 1 (1 1 AVOL)R1  ____________________   RL 1 (1 1 AVOL) R1  
Since AVOL is usually much greater than 1, this reduces to:
  iout ___ iin   5   AVOL(R1 1R2)  ____________   RL 1 AVOLR1  Mathematical Derivations 1015Furthermore, AVOLR2 is usually much greater than RL, and the foregoing simpli-
fi  es to:
iout ___ iin   5   R2 — R1   1 1
Proof of Eq. (20-17)
The change in capacitor voltage is given by:
DV 5   IT ___ C   (B-10)
In the positive half-cycle of input voltage (Fig. 20-28 a), the capacitor charging 
current is ideally:
I 5   VP ___ R  
Since T is the rundown time of the output ramp, it represents half of the output 
period. If f is the frequency of the input square wave, then T 5 1/2f. Substituting 
for I and T in Eq. (B-10) gives:
DV 5   VP _____ 2fRC  
The input voltage has a peak value of VP, while the output voltage has a peak-to-
peak value of DV. Therefore, the equation can be written as:
vout(p-p)  5   VP — 2fRC  
Proof of Eq. (20-18)
The UTP has a value of 1BVsat and the LTP a value of 2BVsat. Start with the basic 
switching equation that applies to any RC circuit:
v 5 vi 1 (vf 2 vi) (1 2 e2t/RC) (B-11)
where v 5 instantaneous capacitor voltage
vi 5 initial capacitor voltage
vf 5 target capacitor voltage
t 5 charging time
RC 5 time constant
In Fig. 20-32 b, the capacitor charge starts with an initial value of 2BVsat and ends 
with a value of 1BVsat. The target voltage for the capacitor voltage is 1Vsat and 
the capacitor charging time is half a period, T/2. Substitute into Eq. (B-11) to get:
BVsat 5 2BVsat 1 (Vsat 1 BVsat) (1 2 e2T/2RC)
This simplifi  es to:
  2B ______ 1 1 B   5 1 2 e2T/2RC
By rearranging and taking the antilog, the foregoing becomes:
T 5 2RC ln   1 1 B ______ 1 2 B  1016  Appendix BProof of Eq. (21-25)
Start with Eq. (B-11), the switching equation for any RC circuit. In Fig. 21-33, the 
initial capacitor voltage is zero, the target capacitor voltage is 1VCC, and the fi  nal 
capacitor voltage is 12VCC/3. Substitute into Eq. (B-11) to get:
  2VCC _____ 3   5 VCC(1 2 e2W/RC)
This simplifi  es to:
e2W/RC 5   1 __ 3  
Solving for W gives:
W 5 1.0986 RC > 1.1RC
Proof of Eqs. (21-28) and (21-29)
In Fig. 21-36, the capacitor upward charge takes time W. The capacitor voltage 
starts at 1VCC/3 and ends at 12VCC/3 with a target voltage of 1VCC. Substitute 
into Eq. (B-11) to get:
  2VCC _____ 3   5   VCC ____ 3   1 1VCC 2   VCC ____ 3  2 (1 2 e2W/RC)
This simplifi  es to:
e2W/RC 5 0.5

Introduction
In an effort to help the reader understand the concepts presented in this text-
book, key examples and problems are presented with computer simulation using 
 Multisim. Multisim is an interactive circuit simulation software package that al-
lows the user to view their circuit in schematic form while measuring the vari-
ous parameters of the circuit. The ability to quickly create a schematic and then 
analyze the circuit through simulation makes Multisim a wonderful tool to help 
students understand the concepts covered in the study of electronics. In addition, 
Multisim provides the opportunity to practice valuable troubleshooting skills with 
the virtual test equipment without risking the safety of the student or damage to 
the equipment. 
 This appendix will introduce the reader to the features of Multisim that 
directly relate to the study of dc, ac, and semiconductor electronics. The topics 
covered are:
• Work Area 
• Opening a File
• Running a Simulation 
• Saving a File
• Components
• Sources
• Measurement Equipment
• Circuit Examples
• User Customization
• Exporting Data to Excel
• Adding Text and Graphics 
Work Area
The power of this software lies in its simplicity. With just a few steps, a circuit can 
be either retrieved from disk or drawn from scratch and then simulated. The main 
screen, as shown in Fig. C-1, is divided into three areas: the drop-down menu, the 
toolbars, and the work area. 
 The drop-down menu gives the user access to all the functions of the 
program, including the visual appearance of the work area. The visual appearance 
of the work area can be modified to suit the user’s needs. For example, the grid 
composed of black dots can be removed and the color scheme can be modified if 
the user intends to capture the schematic for use in printed documents. The Sheet 
Properties menu shown in Fig. C-3 is accessed by clicking on Options in the drop-
down menu shown in Fig. C-2, or by pressing <Alt><O> at the same time.
 The Workspace tab provides access to the grid option, as shown in Fig. C-3. 
Multisim provides a layout grid to help align the various components. When the 
box is checked, the grid is displayed as a series of black dots. When the box is left 
unchecked, the functionality of the grid is still present; however, the dots are not 
visible.1018  Appendix CFigure C-1   Main screen.
Figure C-2   Options drop-down menu.Appendix C  1019The Colors tab provides access to the various color schemes, as shown in Fig. C-4. 
If the schematic is going to be used in a printed document, the white background 
with black wires, components, and text tends to work very well.
 Once the visual appearance of the work area is configured, it will remain 
that way until changed. Once this has been done, a new user need only access a 
few of the drop-down menus to create a circuit, run the simulation, and save the 
circuit for later use. As the user becomes familiar with the software program, they 
can access the various tools within this simulation package through the drop-
down menu. Each of the main drop-down menu topics can be accessed by either a 
mouse click or by pressing the <Alt> key and the underlined letter. For example, 
to access the File menu, simply press <Alt><F> at the same time. The File menu 
will drop down, as shown in Fig. C-5.
 Initially, only two selections from the drop-down menu need to be mas-
tered: opening a file and saving a file. The rest of the menu options can be ex-
plored as time permits. 
 The toolbars beneath the drop-down menu and on the right side of the 
work area provide access to the commonly used menu selections. Typically, a user 
will access them through the toolbars instead of the drop-down menus. The most 
important icon in the assorted toolbars is the on-off switch. The on-off switch 
starts and stops the simulation. The push button next to the on-off switch will 
cause the simulation to pause. Pressing the Pause button while the simulation is 
running allows the user to view a waveform or meter reading without the display 
changing.

Appendix C  1021Opening a File
The circuits referenced in this textbook are available on the McGraw-Hill web-
site. The files are divided into folders, one for each chapter. The name of the file 
provides a wealth of information to the user. 
Example:  A typical fi  le name would be “Ch 3 Problems 3-1.” The fi  rst 
part of the fi  le name tells the user that the fi  le is located in the folder labeled 
“Chapter 3.” The second part of the fi  le name tells the user that it is Question 1 
out of the Problems section at the end of Chapter 3. 
Figure C-6   Opening a ﬁ  le.
Figure C-7   Open File dialog box.
1022  Appendix C To open a fi  le, either click on the word “File” located on the drop-down 
menu bar and then click on the Open command, or click on the open folder icon 
located on the toolbar, as shown in Fig. C-6. Both methods will cause the Open 
File dialog box shown in Fig. C-7 to appear. Navigate to the appropriate chapter 
folder and retrieve the fi  le needed.
Running a Simulation
Once the circuit is constructed in the work area, the simulation can be started by 
one of three ways:
• Select Simulate from the drop-down menu and then select Run.
• Press the <F5> key.
• Press the toggle switch with a mouse click.
All three of these methods are illustrated in Fig. C-8. 
Figure C-8   Starting the simulation.
Appendix C  1023Saving a File
If the file has been modified, it needs to be saved under a new file name. As shown 
in Fig. C-9, select File, located on the drop-down menu bar, and then select Save 
As from the drop-down menu. This will cause the Save As dialog box to open. 
Give the file a new name and press the Save button with a mouse click. The pro-
cess is demonstrated in Fig. C-10.
Figure C-9   Save As screen.
1024  Appendix CComponents
There are two kinds of component models used in Multisim: those modeled after 
actual components and those modeled after “ideal” components. Those modeled 
after ideal components are referred to as “virtual” components. There is a broad 
selection of virtual components available, as shown in Fig. C-11. The virtual com-
ponents toolbar can be added to the top of the work area for ease of access, as 
shown in Fig. C-12.Figure C-10   Save As dialog box.
Figure C-11   Virtual component list.
Appendix C  1025Figure C-12   Toolbar selection.
 The difference between the two types of components resides in their 
rated values. The virtual components can have any of their parameters varied, 
whereas those modeled after actual components are limited to real-world values. 
For example, a virtual resistor can have any value resistance and percent toler-
ance, as shown in Fig. C-13. The configuration screen for each component can 
be opened by double-click, selecting the component with a single click and then 
pressing <Ctrl><M>, or by selecting the component with a single click and then 
choosing Properties in the drop-down menu.
 The models of the actual resistors are available with tolerance values of 
0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 percent. The same is true for all other components mod-
eled after real components, as shown in Fig. C-14. This is especially important 
when the semiconductor devices are used in a simulation. Each of the models of 
actual semiconductors will function in accordance with their data sheets. These 
components will be listed by their actual device number as identified by the man-
ufacturers. For example, a common diode is the 1N4001. This diode, along with 
many others, can be found in the semiconductor library of actual components. 
The parameters of the actual component libraries can also be modified, but that 
requires an extensive understanding of component modeling and is beyond the 
scope of this appendix. 
 If actual components are selected for a circuit to be simulated, the mea-
sured value may differ slightly from the calculated values, as the software will 
utilize the tolerances to vary the results. If precise results are required, the virtual 
components can be set to specific values with a zero percent tolerance.1026  Appendix CFigure C-13   Conﬁ  guration screen for a virtual resistor. 
Figure C-14   Component listing for resistors.
Appendix C  1027Figure C-16   Switch conﬁ  guration screen.
 Several of the components require interaction with the user. The two 
most commonly used interactive components are the switch and the potentiom-
eter. The movement of the switch is triggered by pressing the key associated with 
each switch, as shown in Fig. C-15. The key is selected while in the switch con-
fi guration screen, seen in Fig. C-16. If two switches are assigned the same key, 
they both will move when the key is pressed. The DIP switch packs are available 
in 2 to 10 switch confi  gurations. Each individual switch within the switch pack 
is activated by either pressing the associated key or by a mouse click. When the 
cursor is placed over an individual switch within a switch pack, a white rectangle 
appears around the switch and the cursor changes into a pointing hand symbol. 
When the white rectangle is present and the cursor resembles a pointing hand, a 
single mouse click will cause the switch to change positions. The black dot on the 
switch pack signifi  es the ON position.Figure C-15   Switches.
1028  Appendix CFigure C-17   Potentiometer.
Figure C-18   Potentiometer conﬁ  guration screen.
 The second commonly used component that requires interaction with the 
user is the potentiometer. The potentiometer will vary its resistance in predeter-
mined steps with each key press. Pressing the associated letter on the keyboard 
will increase the resistance, and pressing the <Shift> key and the letter will de-
crease the resistance. A “slider” located to the right of the potentiometer can also 
be used to adjust the resistance value by dragging it with the mouse. As shown in 
Fig. C-17, the percent of the total resistance is displayed next to the potentiom-
eter. The incremental increase or decrease of resistance is set by the user in the 
configuration screen. The associated key is also set in the configuration screen, as 
shown in Fig. C-18.Appendix C  1029Sources
In the study of dc and ac electronics, the majority of the circuits include either a 
voltage or current source. There are two main types of voltage sources: dc and 
ac sources. The dc source can be represented two ways: as a battery, shown in 
Fig. C-19, and as a voltage supply. 
 The voltage rating is fully adjustable. The default value is 12 VDC. If 
the component is double-clicked, the confi  guration screen shown in Fig. C-20 will 
appear and the voltage value can be changed.
 The voltage supplies are used in semiconductor circuits to represent ei-
ther a positive or negative voltage supply. Figure C-21 contains the +V CC voltage 
supply used in transistor circuits. FET circuits will utilize the +V DD voltage sup-
ply, as illustrated in Fig. C-22. 
 Figure C-23 depicts the +V CC and the –V EE voltage sources. These 
sources are found in operational amplifier circuits. Operational amplifiers typi-
cally have two voltage supplies: a negative (–V EE) and a positive (+V CC) voltage 
supply, as shown in Fig. C-24.Figure C-19   DC source as a 
battery.
Figure C-21   V CC voltage source. 
 Figure C-22   V DD voltage source.
Figure C-23   V CC and V EE voltage sources.
Figure C-20   Conﬁ  guration screen for the dc source. 
1030  Appendix C The voltage rating is fully adjustable for all three voltage sources. 
The default value is +5 VDC for VCC and VDD. The default value for VEE is –5 
VDC. If the component is double-clicked, the confi  guration screen shown in 
Fig. C-25 will appear and the voltage value can be changed.
 The ac source can be represented as either a schematic symbol or it can 
take the form of a function generator. The schematic symbol for an ac source can 
represent either a power source or a signal voltage source. The amplitude of the 
power source will be given in RMS voltage ( VRMS), whereas the amplitude of the 
signal voltage source will be given in peak voltage ( VP). 
 The schematic symbols for the two ac sources, as shown in Fig. C-26, 
will include information about the ac source. This information will include the de-
vice reference number, VRMS value or VP value, frequency, and phase shift. These 
values are fully adjustable. The default values for the two sources are shown in 
Fig. C-26. If the component is double-clicked, the confi  guration screen will open 
up and the values can be changed, as shown in Fig. C-27.Figure C-24   V CC and V EE op-amp 
example. 
Figure C-25   V CC conﬁ  guration screen.
Figure C-26   AC sources.
Appendix C  1031 Multisim provides two function generators: the generic model and the 
Agilent model. The Agilent model 33120A has the same functionality as the ac-
tual Agilent function generator.
 The generic function generator icon is shown in Fig. C-28, along with 
the confi  guration screen. The confi  guration screen is displayed when the func-
tion generator icon is double-clicked. The generic function generator can produce 
three types of waveforms: sinusoidal wave, triangular wave, and square wave. 
The frequency, duty cycle, amplitude, and dc offset are all fully adjustable.
 The Agilent function generator is controlled via the front panel, as shown 
in Fig. C-29. The buttons are “pushed” by a mouse click. The dial can be turned 
by dragging the mouse over it or by placing the cursor over it and spinning the 
wheel on the mouse. The latter is by far the preferred method.Figure C-27   Conﬁ  guration screens for the two ac sources.
Figure C-28   Generic function generator and conﬁ  guration screen.
1032  Appendix C There are two types of current sources: dc and ac sources. The dc current 
source is represented as a circle with an upward-pointing arrow in it. The arrow 
in Fig. C-30 represents the direction of current flow. The arrow can be pointed 
downward by rotating the symbol 180 degrees. 
 The current rating is fully adjustable. The default value is 1 A. If the 
component is double-clicked, the configuration screen in Fig. C-31 will appear 
and the current value can be changed.
 The ac current source is represented as a circle with an upward point-
ing arrow. There is a sine wave across the arrow. The schematic symbol in Figure C-29   Agilent function generator.
Figure C-30   DC current source.
 Figure C-31   DC current source conﬁ  guration screen.
Appendix C  1033Fig. C-32 will include information about the ac current source. This information 
will include the device reference number, amplitude ( IPk), offset, frequency, and 
phase shift. These values are all fully adjustable. The default values are shown in 
Fig. C-33. If the component is double-clicked, the confi  guration screen will ap-
pear and the values can be changed.
 Multisim requires a ground to be present in the circuit in order for the 
simulation to function properly. In addition to the circuit, all instrumentation 
with an available ground connection must have that connection tied to ground. 
The circuit and instrumentation can share a common ground point, or individ-
ual ground symbols may be used. The schematic symbol for ground is shown 
in Fig. C-34.
Measurement Equipment
Multisim provides a wide assortment of measurement equipment. In the study 
of dc, ac, and semiconductor electronics, the three main pieces of measurement 
equipment are the digital multimeter, the oscilloscope, and the Bode plotter. The 
first two pieces of equipment are found in test labs across the world. The Bode 
plotter is a virtual device that automates the task of plotting voltage gain over a 
wide range of frequencies. This is usually done by taking many measurements and 
plotting the results in a spreadsheet. The Bode plotter automates this time-con-
suming process.Figure C-32   AC current source.
Figure C-34    Ground.
Figure C-33   AC current source conﬁ  guration screen.
1034  Appendix CMultimeters
There are two multimeters to choose from: the generic multimeter and the Agilent 
multimeter. The generic multimeter can measure current, voltage, resistance, and 
decibels. The meter can be used for both dc and ac measurements. The differ-
ent functions of the meter are selected by double-clicking the icon to the left in 
Fig. C-35. The double-click will cause the multimeter face to be displayed. The 
different functions on the display can be selected by pushing the different buttons 
via a mouse click.
 The Agilent multimeter icon and meter display are shown in Fig. C-36. 
The display is brought up by double-clicking the Agilent multimeter icon. This 
multimeter has the same functionality as the actual Agilent multimeter. The dif-
ferent functions are accessed by pushing the buttons. This is accomplished by 
clicking on the button. The input jacks on the right side of the meter display 
correspond to the five inputs on the icon. If something is connected to the icon, 
the associated jacks on the display will have a white “X” in them to show a con-
nection.

Figure C-36   Agilent multimeter icon and meter display.
Appendix C  1035Oscilloscopes
There are three oscilloscopes to choose from: the generic oscilloscope, the Agi-
lent oscilloscope, and the Tektronix oscilloscope. The generic oscilloscope shown 
in Fig. C-37 is a dual-channel oscilloscope. The oscilloscope display is brought up 
by double-clicking the oscilloscope icon. The settings can be changed by click-
ing in each box and bringing up the scroll arrows. The color of the traces will 
match the color of the wire segments connecting the oscilloscope to the circuit. 
To change the color of the trace, right-click on the wire segment connecting the 
oscilloscope to the circuit and then select Color Segment from the Properties 
menu. Select the color for the wire segment and corresponding trace from the 
color palette. 
 The Agilent oscilloscope icon in Fig. C-38 has all of the functionality of 
the Model 54622D dual-channel oscilloscope. The Agilent oscilloscope is con-
trolled via the front panel, as shown in Fig. C-39. The buttons are “pushed” by 
a mouse click. The dials can be turned by dragging the mouse over them or by 
placing the cursor over them and spinning the wheel on the mouse. The latter is 
by far the preferred method.

Figure C-38   Agilent oscilloscope icon.
1036  Appendix C The Tektronix oscilloscope icon shown in Fig. C-40 has all of the func-
tionality of the Model TDS2024 four-channel digital storage oscilloscope. The 
color of the four channels is the same as the channel selection buttons on the dis-
play: yellow, blue, purple, and green for channels one through four, respectively. 
The Tektronix oscilloscope is controlled via the front panel, as seen in Fig. C-41. 
The buttons are “pushed” by a mouse click. The dials can be turned by dragging 
the mouse over them or by placing the cursor over them and spinning the wheel 
on the mouse. The latter is by far the preferred method.Figure C-39   Agilent oscilloscope display.

oscilloscope icon.
Appendix C  1037Voltage and Current Meters
Multisim provides simple voltmeters and ammeters, as shown in Fig. C-42, for 
use when voltage or current needs to be measured. These meters can be placed 
throughout the circuit. They are available in both vertical and horizontal orienta-
tions to match the layout of the circuit. The default is dc. If the meters are to be 
used for ac measurement, then the configuration screen shown in Fig. C-43 must 
be opened and that parameter changed to reflect ac measurement. To open the 
configuration screen, double-click the meter.
Bode Plotter
The Bode plotter is used to view the frequency response of a circuit. In the actual 
lab setting, the circuit would be operated at a base frequency and the output of 
the circuit measured. The frequency would be incremented by a fixed amount and 
the measurement repeated. After operating the circuit at a sufficient number of 
incremental frequencies, the data would be graphed, with independent variable 
“frequency” on the x-axis and dependent variable “amplitude” on the y-axis. This 
process can be very time-consuming. Multisim provides a simpler method of de-
termining the frequency response of a circuit with the virtual Bode plotter.
 In Fig. C-44, the positive terminal of the input is connected to the applied 
signal source. The positive terminal of the output is connected to the output signal 
of the circuit. The other two terminals are connected to ground. The amplitude or 
frequency settings of the ac source do not matter; the ac source just needs to be in 
the circuit. The Bode plotter will provide the input signal.Figure C-42   Voltage and current meters.

 Using volts per division and the seconds per division settings, the ampli-
tude and frequency of the waveform in Fig. C-68 can be determined. The ampli-
tude of the waveform is two divisions above zero volts. (The yellow arrow points

Figure C-75   Access to the Sheet 
Properties submenu. The grid pattern can be turned off in the Sheet Properties submenu of 
the Options menu. The grid will still be used to align the components; however, 
the dots will not be visible. To access the Sheet Properties submenu, either press 
<Alt><O> or click on Options in the drop-down menu at the top of the screen, as 
shown in Fig. C-75.1054  Appendix C The Sheet Properties submenu shown in Fig. C-76 will allow the user to 
control the work area environment. The Workspace tab gives the user access to 
the grid controls, the sheet size, and orientation.
 The initial configuration of Multisim will display the net names within 
the circuit. The net names are the numbers circled in red in Fig. C-77.
 If the net names are a distraction, they can be turned off from within 
the Sheet Visibility tab of the Sheet Properties submenu, as shown in Fig. C-78. 
In addition to controlling the display of the net names, this tab gives the user ac-
cess to which component parameters that are displayed at the global level. The 
background color and the color of the various components and wiring are selected

1056  Appendix CExporting Data to Excel
The Bode plotter and the oscilloscope were introduced in the “Measurement 
Equipment” section. Although the display of the Bode plotter and the oscilloscope 
is quite informative, it may be useful to have the data in numerical form for fur-
ther analysis. After the Bode plotter simulation is run or a waveform is viewed on 
the oscilloscope, the data can be viewed in the Grapher. The Grapher is located in 
the View drop-down menu. To access the View menu, either press <Alt><V> or 
click View in the drop-down menu at the top of the screen, as shown in Fig. C-80.
 If Excel is also loaded on the computer, the data used to generate the plot 
in the Grapher can be exported to an Excel worksheet for further analysis. The 
plot to be exported must be selected by clicking on it. The red indicator arrow on 
the Grapher screen, as shown in Fig. C-81, points to the plot to be exported. 
 Once the plot is selected, the data can be exported to an Excel worksheet 
by clicking on the Excel icon in the upper-right side of the toolbar, as shown in 
Fig. C-81. The export feature will create a new worksheet with the X and Y data 
in adjacent columns. Figure C-82 shows data from the generic oscilloscope cap-
tured by the Grapher.
Figure C-80   The View menu provides access to the Grapher.Appendix C  1057

Figure C-82   Exporting oscilloscope data to Excel.1058  Appendix C Once the Export to Excel icon is clicked, Multisim will prompt the user 
for the desired trace to be exported, as shown in Fig. C-83. As part of the export 
process, Excel will be started and a new worksheet will be created with the data 
from the x-axis in column A and the data from the y-axis in column B. The data 
used to create the waveform within Multisim can now be examined using the 
analytical capabilities of Excel.
Adding Text and Graphics
Simply constructing the circuit and running the simulation is only part of the 
overall process. It is also important to create circuits that include information that 
clearly explains what is taking place. Both annotation and graphics can be added 
to a circuit schematic to aid in the viewer’s understanding. To add text to the work 
area, either press <Ctrl><Alt><A> or click on Place in the drop-down menu at the 
top of the screen, as shown in Fig. C-86. Move the cursor to the location within 
the work area where the text should begin and click the mouse once. To exit the 
“text edit” mode after the text has been entered, click anywhere on the work area. 
The text can be edited by double-clicking the text. The text can be repositioned in 
the work area by placing the cursor over the text, holding down the mouse button, 
and dragging the text to its new location.
Figure C-83   Select the trace for export.

Figure C-86   Placing text in the work area.1060  Appendix C Basic drawing tools are available to annotate the work area. The option 
to import a picture into the work area is also accessible from the Graphics dialog 
box. As shown in Fig. C-87, click Place from the drop-down menu bar, and then 
select Graphics from the drop-down menu. This will cause the Graphics dialog 
box to open. The default file format for pictures to be inserted into the drawing is 
bitmap (.bmp).
 Once the lines or shapes are drawn, they can be modified or repositioned. 
A right-click on a line or shape will cause the Edit menu to open, as shown in 
Fig. C-88. The properties of the object can be changed in the Edit menu. The line 
or shape can be repositioned by placing the cursor over the object and holding the 
mouse button down while it is dragged to its new location. 
Figure C-87   Placing graphics in the work area.Appendix C  1061 Tools within Multisim provide the ability to add graphics and text to the 
work area. This feature enhances the readability of the schematic, especially when 
it is going to be used in a laboratory report. Figure C-89 provides an example of 
an annotated schematic that could be used within a laboratory report. Notice how 
the addition of color, text, and graphics helps document what is being measured 
within the circuit. 
Figure C-88   Modifying the graphics in the work area.1062  Appendix CConclusion
Multisim is an interactive circuit simulation package that allows the user to view 
their circuit in schematic form while measuring the various parameters of the cir-
cuit. The ability to create a schematic quickly and then analyze the circuit through 
simulation makes Multisim a wonderful tool for students studying the concepts 
covered in this textbook.

Thevenizing the R/2R D/A 
Converter
With the switches D0 2 D4 connected as in Fig. D-1 a, the binary input is D0 51, 
D1 5 0, D2 5 0, and D3 5 0. First, Thevenize the circuit from point A, looking 
toward D0. When doing so, R5 (20 k V) becomes parallel with R1 (20 k V) and the 
equivalent equals 10 k V. The Thevenized voltage at point A is one-half of Vref and 
is equal to 12.5 V . This equivalent is shown in Fig. D-1 b.
 Next, Thevenize Fig. D-1 b from point B. Notice how RTH (10 k V) is in 
series with R6 (10 k V). This 20-k V value is in parallel with R2 (20 k V) and again 
gives us 10 k V. The Thevenized voltage seen from point B is again reduced by 
half to 1.25 V . This equivalent is shown in Fig. D-1 c.
 Now, Thevenize Fig. D-1 c from point C. Again, RTH (10 k V) is in series 
with R7 (10 k V) and this 20-k V value becomes parallel with R3 (10 k V). VTH is 
equal to 0.625 V . Notice how the VTH values have been cut in half at each step. The 
Thevenin equivalent has been reduced to that of Fig. D-1 d.
 In Fig. D-1 d, the op amp’s inverting input and the top of R4 (20 k V) is at a 
virtual ground. The voltage is equal to zero volts at this point. This places the  entire 
0.625 V of VTH across RTH and R8 (10 k V). This results in an input current Iin of:
Iin 5   0.625 V _______ 20 kV   5 31.25 mA
Again, because of the virtual ground, this input current is forced to fl  ow through 
Rf (20 k V) and produces an output voltage of:
Vout 5 2(Iin Rf) 5 2(31.25 mA)(20 k V) 5 20.625 V
This output voltage is the smallest output increment above 0 V and is referred to 
as the circuit’s output resolution.

Digital/Analog Trainer System 1069
1070  555 timer  A widely used circuit that can run in 
either of two modes: monostable or astable. 
In monostable, it can produce  accurate time 
delays, and in astable, it can produce rectan-
gular waves with a variable duty cycle.
P model  An ac model of a transistor shaped 
like the Greek symbol P.
A
absolute value  The value of an expression 
without regard for its sign. Sometimes called 
the magnitude.  Given 15 and –5, the abso-
lute value is 5.
acceptor  A trivalent atom, one that has three 
 valence electrons. Each trivalent atom 
 produces one hole in a silicon crystal.
ac collector resistance  The total ac load re-
sistance found at the circuit’s collector. This 
is often the parallel combination of RC and 
RL. This value is important when determin-
ing the voltage gain of a common-base or 
 common-emitter a mplifi  er.
ac compliance  A large-signal amplifi  er with 
its Q point at the middle of the ac load 
line  allowing a maximum peak-to-peak 
 unclipped output.
ac current gain  With a transistor, the ratio of 
ac collector current to ac base current.
ac cutoff   The lower end of the ac load line. At 
this point, the transistor goes into cutoff and 
clips the ac signal.
ac emitter feedback  The ac signal developed 
across an unbypassed emitter resistance re.
ac emitter resistance  The ac base-emitter 
voltage divided by the ac emitter current. This 
value is normally listed as re9 and can be 
 calculated by re9 5   25 mV ______  IE  . This value is 
 important when determining the input 
 impedance and gain of a BJT amplifi  er.
ac-equivalent circuit  All that remains when 
you reduce the dc sources to zero and short 
all capacitors.
ac ground  A node that is bypassed to ground 
through a capacitor. Such a node will show 
no ac voltage when it is probed by an 
 oscilloscope, but it will indicate a dc voltage 
when it is measured with a voltmeter.
ac load line  The locus of instantaneous oper-
ating points when an ac signal is driving the 
transistor. This load line is different from the 
dc load line whenever the ac load resistance 
is different from the dc load resistance.
ac resistance  The resistance of a device to 
a small ac signal. The ratio of a voltage change to a current change. The key idea 
here is changes about an operating point.
ac saturation  The upper end of the ac load 
line. At this point, the transistor goes into 
 saturation and clips the ac signal.
ac short  A coupling capacitor or bypass 
 capacitor can be treated as an ac short if 
its capacitive reactance XC is less than 
1/10 of the resistance R. This can be stated 
 mathematically a s XC , 0.1R.
active current gain  The current gain in the 
 active region of a transistor. That is what you 
usually fi  nd on a data sheet and what most 
people mean when they talk about  current 
gain. (See saturated current gain. )
active ﬁ  lter In the good old days, fi  lters were 
made out of passive components like in-
ductors and capacitors. Some fi  lters are still 
made this way. The problem is that at low 
frequencies, inductors become very large in 
passive fi  lter designs. Op amps give another 
way to build fi  lters and eliminate the prob-
lem of bulky inductors at low frequencies. 
Any fi  lter using an op amp is called an 
 active fi  lter.
active half-wave rectiﬁ  er An op amp circuit 
with the ability to rectify signals with input 
voltages less than 0.7 V . This circuit makes 
use of the very large open-loop gain of an 
op amp and is also known as a precision 
 rectifi  er.
active loading  This refers to using a bipolar 
or MOS transistor as a resistor. It’s done 
to save space or to get resistances that are 
 diffi cult with passive resistors.
active-load resistor  An FET with its gate 
 connected to the drain. The resulting 
two-terminal device is equivalent to a 
resistor.
active peak detector  An op amp circuit used 
to detect low-level signals.
active positive clamper  An op amp circuit 
used to add a positive dc component to an 
input signal.
active positive clipper  An adjustable op amp 
circuit used to precisely control the level of 
positive output voltage.
active region  Sometimes called the linear 
 region.  It refers to that part of the collector 
curve that is approximately horizontal. 
A transistor operates in the active region 
when it is used as an amplifi  er. In the active 
 region, the emitter diode is forward-biased, 
the collector diode is reverse-biased, the 
 collector current almost equals the emitter current, and the base current is much smaller 
than either the emitter or collector current.
all-pass ﬁ  lter A specialized fi  lter with the ideal 
ability to pass all frequencies between zero 
and infi  nity. This fi  lter is also called a phase 
fi  lter  because of its ability to shift the phase 
of the output signal without changing the 
magnitude.
ambient temperature  The temperature of the 
immediate surrounding air around a device.
ampliﬁ  er A circuit that can increase the peak-
to-peak voltage, current, or power of a 
signal.
amplitude  The size of a signal, usually its peak 
value.
analog  The branch of electronics dealing with 
infi  nitely varying quantities. Often referred 
to as linear electronics.
analogy  A likeness in some ways between 
 dissimilar things that are otherwise unlike. 
The analogy between bipolar transistors 
and JFETs is an example. Because the de-
vices are similar, many of the equations for 
them are identical except for a change of 
 subscripts.
anode  The element of an electronic device that 
receives the fl  ow of electron current.
approximation  A way to retain your sanity 
with semiconductor devices. Exact answers 
are tedious and time consuming and almost 
never justifi  ed in the real world of electron-
ics. On the other hand, approximations give 
us quick answers, usually adequate for the 
job at hand.
Armstrong oscillator  A circuit distinguished 
by its use of transformer coupling for the 
feedback signal.
astable  A digital switching circuit with no sta-
ble states. This circuit is also referred to as a 
free-running  circuit.
attenuation  A reduction in signal intensity, 
 normally expressed in decibels. The sig-
nal reduction value is compared to the 
signal level at the midband of the fi  lter. 
 Mathematically, it is expressed as 
  attenuation 5   vout ______ vout(mid)   and decibel 
  attenuation 5 20 log attenuation.
audio ampliﬁ  er Any amplifi  er designed for the 
audio range of frequencies, 20 Hz to 20 kHz.
automatic gain control (AGC)  A circuit 
 designed to correct the gain of an amplifi  er 
according to the amplitude of the incoming 
signal.
avalanche eff  ect A phenomenon that occurs for 
large reverse voltages across a pn junction. GlossaryGlossary 1071carrier  The high-frequency output signal of a 
transmitter that is caused to vary in ampli-
tude, frequency, or phase by a modulating 
signal.
cascaded stages  Connecting two or more 
stages so that the output of one stage is the 
input to the next.
case temperature  This is the temperature of 
the transistor case or package. When you 
pick up a transistor, you are in contact with 
the case. If the case is warm, you are feeling 
the case temperature.
cathode  The element of an electronic device 
that provides the fl  ow of electron current.
CB ampliﬁ  er An amplifi  er confi  guration in 
which the input signal is fed into the emitter 
terminal and the output signal is taken from 
the collector terminal.
CC ampliﬁ  er An amplifi  er confi  guration in 
which the input signal is fed into the base 
 terminal and the output signal is taken from 
the emitter terminal. Also called emitter 
 follower.
CE ampliﬁ  er The most widely applied ampli-
fi  er confi  guration, in which the input signal 
is fed into the base terminal and the output 
 signal is taken from the collector circuit.
channel  The n-type or p-type semiconductor 
material that provides the main current path 
between the source and drain of a fi  eld effect 
transistor.
Chebyshev ﬁ  lter A fi lter with extremely good 
selectivity. The attenuation rate is much 
higher than that of Butterworth fi  lters. The 
main problem with this fi  lter is the ripple in 
the passband.
chip  This has two meanings. First, an IC man-
ufacturer produces hundreds of circuits on 
a large wafer of semiconductor material. 
Then the wafer is cut into individual chips, 
each containing one monolithic circuit. In 
this case, no leads have been connected to 
the chip. The chip is still an isolated piece 
of semiconductor material. Second, after 
the chip has been put inside a package and 
 external leads have been connected to it, 
you have a fi  nished IC. This fi  nished IC is 
also referred to as a chip.  For instance, we 
can call a 741C a chip.
chopper  A JFET circuit that uses either a shunt 
or a series switch to convert a dc input 
 voltage to a square-wave output.
clamper  A circuit for adding a dc component to 
an ac signal. Also known as a dc restorer.
Clapp oscillator  A series-tuned Colpitts 
confi  guration noted for its good frequency 
stability.
Class-A operation  This means the transistor is 
conducting throughout the ac cycle without 
going into saturation or cutoff.
Class-AB operation  A power amplifi  er biased 
so that each transistor conducts slightly 
more than 180° of the input signal to reduce 
crossover distortion.
Class-B operation  Biasing of a transistor in 
such a way that it conducts for only half of 
the ac cycle.increases or decreases the same amount as the 
noninverting input voltage initiates.
breakdown region  For a diode or transistor, 
it is the region where either avalanche or 
the zener effect occurs. With the exception 
of the zener diode, operation in the break-
down region is to be avoided under all 
circumstances because it usually destroys 
the  device.
breakdown voltage  The maximum reverse 
voltage a diode can withstand before ava-
lanche or the zener effect occurs.
breakover  When a transistor breaks down, the 
voltage across it remains high. But with a 
thyristor, breakdown turns into saturation. In 
other words, breakover refers to the way a 
thyristor breaks down and then immediately 
goes into saturation.
bridge rectiﬁ  er The most common type of rec-
tifi  er circuit. It has four diodes, two of which 
are conducting at the same time. For a given 
transformer, it produces the largest dc output 
voltage with the smallest ripple.
buck-boost regulator  The basic topology 
for a switching regulator circuit in which a 
 positive input voltage produces a negative 
output voltage.
buck regulator  The basic topology for a 
switching regulator circuit in which the out-
put voltage is lower than the input voltage.
buff er A unity gain amplifi  er (voltage follower) 
with a high input impedance and a low 
output impedance used primarily to provide 
isolation between two parts of a circuit.
buff  er ampliﬁ  er This is an amplifi  er that you 
use to isolate two other circuits when one 
is overloading the other. A buffer amplifi  er 
usually has a very high input impedance, a 
very low output impedance, and a voltage 
gain of 1. These qualities mean that the 
buffer amplifi  er will transmit the output of 
the fi  rst circuit to the second circuit without 
changing the signal.
bulk resistance  The ohmic resistance of the 
semiconductor material.
Butterworth ﬁ  lter This is a fi  lter designed to 
produce as fl  at a response as possible up 
to the cutoff frequency. In other words, the 
 output voltage remains constant almost all 
the way to the cutoff frequency. Then it 
 decreases at 20 n dB per decade, where n 
is the number of poles in the fi  lter.
bypass capacitor  A capacitor used to ground 
a node.
C
capacitive coupling  The use of a capacitor to 
pass the ac signal from one stage to another 
while blocking the dc component of the 
waveform.
capacitor input ﬁ  lter Nothing more than a 
 capacitor across the load resistor. This type 
of passive fi  lter is the most common.
capture range  The range of input frequencies 
in which a phase-locked-loop (PLL) circuit 
can lock on to the input signal.The free electrons are accelerated to such 
high speeds that they can dislodge valence 
electrons. When this happens, the valence 
electrons become free electrons that  dislodge 
other valence electrons.
averager  An op-amp circuit constructed to pro-
vide an output voltage equal to the average 
of all input voltages.
B
back diode  A diode with properties that enable 
it to conduct better in the reverse direction 
than in the forward direction. Commonly 
used in the rectifi  cation of weak signals.
bandpass ﬁ  lter A fi lter capable of passing a 
range of input frequencies with minimum 
 attenuation while blocking all frequencies 
below and above the lower and upper cutoff 
frequencies f1 and f2.
bandstop ﬁ  lter A fi lter capable of rejecting a 
range of input frequencies while effectively 
passing all frequencies below and above the 
cutoff frequencies f1 and f2. This fi  lter is also 
referred to as a notch fi  lter.
bandwidth  The difference between the two 
dominant critical frequencies of an ampli-
fi  er. If the amplifi  er has no lower critical 
 frequency, the bandwidth equals the upper 
critical frequency.
barrier potential  The voltage across the de-
pletion layer. This voltage is built into the 
pn junction because it is the difference of 
 potential between the ions on both sides of 
the junction. It equals approximately 0.7 V 
for a silicon diode.
base  The middle part of a transistor. It is thin 
and lightly doped. This permits electrons 
from the emitter to pass through it to the 
 collector.
base bias  The worst way to bias a transistor 
for use in the active region. This type of bias 
sets up a fi  xed value of base current.
Bessel ﬁ  lter Filter providing the desired 
 frequency response but with a constant 
time delay in the passband.
BIFET op amp  An IC op amp that combines 
FETs and bipolar transistors, usually with 
FET source followers at the front end of the 
device, followed by bipolar stages of gain.
bipolar junction transistor (BJT)  A transistor 
where both free electrons and holes are

age gain A and the feedback fraction B. The 
value of this product is usually very large.

tions from occurring.

saturation current  The current in a reverse- 
biased diode caused by thermally produced

a transistor in the saturation region. This 
value is less than the active current gain. 
For soft saturation, the current gain is 
slightly less than the active current gain. 
For hard saturation, the current gain is ap-
proximately 10.

location of the saturation point is slightly 
lower because the collector-emitter voltage 
is not quite zero.

the junction temperature to increase further, 
producing more collector current, etc., until 
the transistor is destroyed.
thermal shutdown  A feature found in modern 
three-terminal IC regulators. When the reg-
ulator exceeds a safe operating temperature, 
the pass transistor is cut off and the output 
voltage goes to zero. When the device cools, 
the pass transistor is again turned on. If the 
original cause of the excessive temperature 
is still present, the device again shuts off.

transistor that operates in the linear region. 
A switching regulator uses a transistor that
